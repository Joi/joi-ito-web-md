> We received this happy missive in the mail yesterday: The plaintiffs in the [lawsuit about Virgin using a CC-licensed photo](http://lessig.org/blog/2007/09/on_the_texas_suit_against_virg.html) have dismissed CC from the case. This is not a settlement. It is not the product of negotiation. It is the recognition by plaintiffs counsel that the laws of Texas and the United States give the plaintiffs no cause to sue Creative Commons.

これはいいニュースだ。CCコミュニティーの何人ものボランティアを含め，この件について尽力したチームのすべての人に，おめでとうと言いたい。
