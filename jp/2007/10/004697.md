Philippと利他主義に関して話し合った。彼が[iCommons.orgのサイト](http://www.icommons.org/)に投稿した，一連の記事でのやりとりに続くものだ。最後はとりとめがなくなって，彼に話す時間を十分あげられなかったけれど，とても楽しかった。サイトにある他の記事もチェックして，利他主義に関する僕の理論についてどう思うか教えてくれるとうれしい。;-)

> Listen to Joi Ito and Philipp Schmidt discuss altruism, the economic man, the difference between happiness and pleasure, carriers of compassion, and that being a happy sharer yourself, is the best way to get others to share as well.

The conversation starts off with an overview of Marcel Mauss' [The Gift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gift_(book)), and the Dalai Lama's [The Art of Happiness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Happiness), which address the issue of sharing from very different directions. The Gift provides a historical framework for sharing that is non-financial, and sets out a clear process of sharing that runs counter to our economies' urge to commoditise. The Dalai Lama develops a theory of happiness that is grounded on compassion, and the ability of human people to learn happiness. Why is it that we learn Maths and Sciences in school, but don't seem interested in learning and teaching how to be happy?

Joi then sets out a profoundly optimistic model for collaborative citizenry that will help us identify, and ultimately address, global challenges like climate change. He makes a convincing argument that happiness comes from things like community and a well functioning family, where more is not necessarily better, and that the best way to bring others into this movement is to let them participate in our functional communities of sharing, and to be happy.

Note: The book mentioned by Joi is Scott Page's [The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8353.html).
