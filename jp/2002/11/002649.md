米国国防省が匿名性をネットからなくすことが出来るかどうかのリサーチをSRIに発注しました。かなりもめた結果そのアイディアをやめました。エキスパート達はかなり反対したのですが、SRIは黙らせようとしたらしい。ちょうど僕も今回の内部通報者保護法でも匿名性の必要性を政府に件としてもらおうとしているので、今回の話は面白い。

he Pentagon research agency that is exploring how to create a vast database of electronic transactions and analyze them for potential terrorist activity considered but rejected another surveillance idea: tagging Internet data with unique personal markers to make anonymous use of some parts of the Internet impossible.

The idea, which was explored at a two-day workshop in California in August, touched off an angry private dispute among computer scientists and policy experts who had been brought together to assess the implications of the technology.

The plan, known as eDNA, called for developing a new version of the Internet that would include enclaves where it would be impossible to be anonymous while using the network. The technology would have divided the Internet into secure "public network highways," where a computer user would have needed to be identified, and "private network alleyways," which would not have required identification.
