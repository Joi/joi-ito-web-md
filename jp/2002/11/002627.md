これは8月の[財務所がウェッブで早く数字を出しすぎた話](http://joi.ito.com/jp/archive/2002/08/22/mof_leaks_information_on_their_web_page.html)ににてます。その時ある新聞社が新聞にのる前の晩にコメントをもとめた。多分David FarberがWashington Postに言ったようなQuoteがほしかったんだけど、僕は、"個人情報のもれに比べたらたいしたことない"みたいな事を言った覚えがあります。あまり役に立たないQuoteだった。

それと"Internet enthusiasts"って面白いカテゴリーですね。今休みの日なのに朝5時にブロッグしてる僕は"Internet enthusiast"と呼べるのでしょう。

WASHINGTON –– The landmark decision in the Microsoft antitrust trial was supposed to remain secret until after financial markets closed, but the federal court quietly posted the documents on its Web site nearly 90 minutes before the closing bell.

That discovery by some Internet enthusiasts coincided with a flurry of late-day trading of Microsoft's stock. Its price, which had been falling most of Friday, ticked up just moments after the court placed on its Web site the decision that handed Microsoft a huge victory.

Late-day trading peaked five minutes before markets closed, when $90 million worth of Microsoft shares exchanged hands.

The incident meant tech-savvy Web surfers knew the judge's decision fully one hour before even lawyers for Microsoft and the Justice Department. A glitch in Internet technology – which was at the heart of the antitrust trial – contributed to the early disclosure.

"Somebody wasn't thinking," said David Farber, an Internet expert and former chief technologist for the Federal Communications Commission. "They probably uploaded it just to make sure they wouldn't have any trouble, assuming that no one read it, which was probably naive. They're going to have to be a lot more careful."
