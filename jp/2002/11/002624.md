![gears.gif](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/gears.gif)もしかしたらもしかしたらMSのSharepointってブロッグのソフト？MSのLISTSってブロッグのこと？大変。

> Looks like the possible "aoling" of blogspace that I discussed earlier might come from Microsoft, not AOL. Anil Dash has [an article about Microsoft's easy-to-install-and-use "Sharepoint" software](http://www.dashes.com/magazine/backissues/microsofts_weblog_software.php), which is basically a blog tool. But, of course, they don't call it that (shades of the [conversation on Joi Ito's blog](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/10/26/will_it_be_called_blogging.html) about whether this will be called "blogging" when it goes mainstream). They call it "lists." (Cue "Jaws" music here...)
