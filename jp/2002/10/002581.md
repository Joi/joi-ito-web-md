最近出たホアイトハウスの"National Strategy To Secure Cyberspace."にはブッシュとなかがいい業界人のアドバイザーが多くあまり本当のエキスマートはいなかたみたいですね。こういうなんちゃってエキスパートパネルは日本だけじゃないんですね。;-p

このレポートはかなりアメリカの業界と他国の政府からかなり期待されていたみたいですが、読んでもおまりしんせんな事は書いていない。でも、フォーマットはかっこいいし、まー、何も知らなくてステータスがあるものしか読まない人にはいいかも。

Subject: Re: [IP] Interesting - Breakdown of the President's 30 'experts' on  
infrastructure security advisor (NIAC)

Looking at Rick's very informative web site, I toodled over to  
<http://www.whitehouse.gov>  
where the original executive order is listed, #1321.

<http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/10/20011016-12.html>

It has the following wording.

(b) NIAC. There is hereby established the National Infrastructure Advisory  
Council, which shall provide the President advice on the security of  
information systems for critical infrastructure supporting other sectors of  
the economy: banking and finance, transportation, energy, manufacturing, and  
emergency government services. The NIAC shall be composed of not more than  
30 members appointed by the President. The members of the NIAC shall be  
selected from the private sector, academia, and State and local government.  
Members of the NIAC shall have expertise relevant to the functions of the  
NIAC and generally shall be selected from industry Chief Executive Officers  
(and equivalently ranked leaders in other organizations) with  
responsibilities for the security of information infrastructure supporting  
the critical sectors of the economy, including banking and finance,  
transportation, energy, communications, and emergency government services.  
Members shall not be full-time officia!  
ls or employees of the executive branch of the Federal Government.

-------------------

The actual individuals are also listed at:

<http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/09/20020918-12.html>

Some comments:

There's an interesting and implicit assumption in the "Strategy" about  
"ownership and operation of cyberspace", and that one can hope to derive a  
line of responsibility and expertise by involving the CEO (or  
equivalent) of these related companies, in protecting critical  
infrastructure. If this assumption  
is correct, then we should all expect some tangible metrics as to how these  
CEO's implmented  
various parts of the strategy, and what business benefits were derived.
