今回は"mistake"ですが、このように、著作権販売企業ではない、著作者にはどんどん技術的に不利になって行く方に向いてます。こういう「Chilling Effect」によって消費者とアーティストはどんどん離れていくと思います。ＴＨＥ　ＳＩＭＳみたいにファンサイトを応援してゲームにPublic DomainのアートやSkinsをインポート出来るオープンな遊びを提供するサービスの方がもっともっとはやるといいな。多分ボロッグみたいなnon-mass mediaによって、色々違うアートや遊びが普及をすることになるでしょう。

George Ziemann didn't have delusions of grandeur when it came to selling his band's CD.

He just wanted to promote the album -- and hopefully sell a few copies -- on a higher-traffic site than his own. So he turned to eBay, the Net's largest marketplace.

But the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a law meant to limit people from distributing content illegally over the Internet, foiled him.

The reason? He used recordable CDs (CD-Rs) to distribute his albums.

The discs allow people to record data files -- music and movies, for instance -- and they are often used to record and sell pirated wares.

As a precaution against enabling thieves to sell stolen merchandise on the site, eBay launched its [Verified Rights Owner program](http://pages.ebay.com/help/community/vero-program.html), which allows copyright holders to send eBay take-down notices for auctions that violate copyright laws.

The problem in Ziemann's case, he said, is that he's selling his own music.
