I met Tim Leary in 1990. He was a great inspiration to me and introduced me to many of the wonderful people that I know. One of the things we did together was [talk about the web in its early days](http://leary.com/home/guided_tour/index.html). He was very excited about the web and wanted him own web page. He had a great young team called Retina Logic who wanted to build the site so our company, Digital Garage funded part of the development. When the site won [Cool Site of the Year](http://leary.com/awards/coolsite/index.html) in the personal web page category, it was great. Since Tim has passed away, the site has continued to grow. Thanks to the efforts of Chris the web master has continued to serve as a digital legacy to that I think Tim had in mind when you decided to get the site going.
