I’ve just joined the board of directors of [Sanrio Digital](http://www.sanriodigital.com/) based in Hong Kong, which among other things does the online stuff for Hello Kitty. It’s a joint venture between Sanrio and Typhoon Games which is run by my good friend Yat Siu. [A full press release is on their blog.](http://www.sanriodigital.com/archives/37)

I am now reachable at joi (at) hellokitty.com. ;-)

UPDATE: You can see the various services we are providing already at [Sanriotown](http://www.sanriotown.com). You can get your free Hello Kitty email address there too.
