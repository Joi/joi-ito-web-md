[Kara Swisher](http://kara.allthingsd.com/) is one of the smartest, funniest and sometimes cruelest journalists I know. She is a co-host of the Wall Street Journal [All Things Digital](http://allthingsd.com/) conference with [Walt Mossberg](http://walt.allthingsd.com/).

For a variety of reasons she’s having a hard time getting an interview with Jerry Yang. She discovered that [“Lunch with Jerry Yang” is the prize from DonorsChoose.org Bloggers Challenge](http://yodel.yahoo.com/2007/09/28/you-know-for-the-kids/) for the bloggers who inspire the most readers to give. To participate/give, just go to the [AllThingsD page on the DonorsChoose](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=17217) site.

So… in addition to loving Kara, I also owe her for introducing me to cool people and letting me stay at her house and stuff. When she says, “i need you to flack this…it is for a good cause. also funny” I guess it means I should blog about it. ;-)

Good luck Kara. Sorry Jerry!

But it is a good cause. Really. I’m going to give right now.

For a more complete description of this whole thing, which is admittedly slightly difficult to understand, see [Kara’s blog post about it.](http://kara.allthingsd.com/20071004/blogger-charity-smackdown/)
