Still early stage but very well done. Enjoying [PhotoPhlow](http://www.photophlow.com/) a lot. Reminds me of proto-Flickr.

Set up a [#joiito](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?IrcChannel) [PhotoPhlow channel](http://www.photophlow.com/flickr/group/35237091574@N01) there and hanging out when I’m free. For now it appears that they will shoot you an invite if you sign up on the site.

Kudos to [iMorpheus](http://www.somethingfromjapan.com/epi/) for the invite.
