Just a note to people who ask me for an introduction to other people or organizations in the format, "Do you happen to know someone at XYZ because I need to reach them about ABC?" The preferred method for these sorts of requests is [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com). If you want to use email, please write it in a format that includes the specifics of what you want and the background in a format that I can forward or Reply-All to so I can make the introduction without having to ask, "do you mind if I forward this email?" Also, PLEASE do not ask me for introductions without telling me WHY you want the introduction. In most cases, this won't happen.

Thanks! (I do around 20 of these a week and shortening the process by one step would save me a lot of time.)
