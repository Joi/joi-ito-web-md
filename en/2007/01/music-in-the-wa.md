I've started getting a rhythm in my swimming and end up staying between and hour and an hour and a half in the pool. I've been going around five times a week. I just realized that this might be a good time to catch up on my music. Jeff sent me a few links to possible solutions from [Kiefer Online](http://www.kiefer.com/). ([Aqua Tune II](http://www.kiefer.com/Kiefer/productr.asp?pf%5Fid=600395) / [Swimmers Waterproof MP3 Player](http://www.kiefer.com/Kiefer/productr.asp?pf%5Fid=600386) ) Has anyone tried either of these or know of something else that actually works without causing too much drag or being dangerous to other people sharing a lane?
