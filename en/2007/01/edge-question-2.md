John Brockman's [EDGE](http://www.edge.org/) asks a tough question every year. For 2007 the question was "What are you optimistic about?" My answer was:
> [*EDGE* World Question Center](http://edge.org/q2007/q07_index.html)
>
> [Emergent Democracy and Global Voices](http://edge.org/q2007/q07_14.html#ito)

I am optimistic that open networks will continue to grow and become available to more and more people. I am optimistic that computers will continue to become cheaper and more available. I am optimistic that the hardware and software will become more open, transparent and free. I am optimistic that the ability to for people to create, share and remix their works will provide a voice to the vast majority of people.

I believe that the Internet, open source and a global culture of discourse and sharing will become the pillar of democracy for the 21st Century. Whereas those in power as well as terrorists who are not have used broadcast technology and the mass media of the 20th century against the free world, I am optimistic that Internet will enable the collective voice of the people and that voice will be a voice of reason and good will.[There are other answers from other people on the website.](http://edge.org/q2007/q07_index.html)

Happy New Year.
