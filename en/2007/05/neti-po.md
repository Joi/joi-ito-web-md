I got my [Neti Pot](http://www.bytheplanet.com/neti-pot-wash2.cfm) today. Neti Pot is the Himalayan Institute version of the pot used for [Jala Neti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jala_neti), a yoga practice where you pour a saline solution in one nose and out the other to clean your nasal passages. My sister Mimi turned me onto the Neti Pot. I was complaining to her about my allergies. I though that my newfound friendship with plants had rid me of them, but they hit me hard recently as I've started to spend more and more time in the garden. Mimi told me that she and Luna haven't gotten nasal allergies since they started doing Neti Pot.

Anyway, I tried it today and it was awesome. I think I put too much salt in the first batch and it burned a bit, but after I got the balance right, it felt great. Not sure what else to say. I'll let you know if they cure my allergies. I guess the reason I'm blogging about it is that I didn't really know much about it until Mimi told me about it. I could imagine easily going through life without actually trying it - which would have sucked. So I thought I'd mention it here after reading [a rather vivid blog post about it.](http://www.rollforinitiative.com/2007/01/08/i_heart_the_neti_pot/) ;-)
