A [Rocketboom](http://www.rocketboom.com/stories/)-like [Japanese news service just launched in Japan.](http://slasla-news.com/) Looks fun. Run by Kobahen a.k.a. Johnny. Johnny was the editor of Wired Japan when it was still around.

Disclosure: I'm a small investor in his company [Infobahn](http://www.infobahn.co.jp/).
