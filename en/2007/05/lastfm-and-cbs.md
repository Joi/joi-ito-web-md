Congrats and "Good job!" to CBS and the [Last.fm](http://last.fm/) team! CBS and Last.fm announced that CBS will be acquiring Last.fm for $280 million. I think it's a good fit and the team seems happy with the deal. [Last.fm have blogged about it](http://blog.last.fm/2007/05/30/lastfm-acquired-by-cbs) and [CBS has an announcement](http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/05-30-2007/0004597909&EDATE=).

I was an angel investor and a series A investor in Last.fm.

UPDATE: [BBC has a good article - Social music site Last.fm has been bought by US media giant CBS Corporation for $280m (£140m), the largest-ever UK Web 2.0 acquisition.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6701863.stm)
