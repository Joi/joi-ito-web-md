Walter Mossberg and Kara Swisher interview Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. [John Markoff wrote a New York Times article about this interview.](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/technology/31digital.html?ex=1338264000&en=6225f0854662fa74&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) They used my photo. w00t!

A few notes of my own that I [posted on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/522695099/):

Bill: "I'd give a lot for Steve's taste."

Steve: "Bill was much better at partnering than Steve Wozniak and I were."

We've kept secret that: Steve: "We've been married for 10 years." [It was actually: "We've kept our marriage secret for over a decade now."]

Bill: "I'm not the Fake Steve."

Quotes from memory. Exact text may be wrong.

UPDATE 2: [The full video is online too.](http://d5.allthingsd.com/20070530/steve-jobs-and-bill-gates-together-part-1-of-7/)
