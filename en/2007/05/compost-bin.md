We finished this compost bin today. Used Google Sketchup to make a sketch, went to the hardware store and bought 2X4s, screen hooks, nails and chicken-wire. It was slightly more work than I anticipated, but everything went pretty much as planned. I'm feeling all vegan-DIY now. ;-)

Next we have to move my compost from my old bin to its new home.
