Dialog box asking you to agree to CC license before downloading to Video Walkman

Saw [Masaki](http://flickr.com/photos/joi/529659468/) and [Takeshi](http://flickr.com/photos/joi/529747075/) from Sony yesterday. They are responsible for [Eyevio](http://eyevio.jp/), Sony's video sharing site. Eyevio uses [CC](http://www.creativecommons.org/) licenses as a default allowing users to select their license when they upload. As Kirai reports, you can sync to the [PSP and the Video Walkman](http://www.kirainet.com/english/eyevio/). They also have it working with the Video iPod. They use H.264 with no DRM and only allow you to sync CC licensed content. My favorite part of the demo Takeshi did or me with his Video Walkman was when Eyevio popped up a dialog box when you were about to sync the videos that said, "Do you agree to abide by this CC license?" Awesome. Really.
