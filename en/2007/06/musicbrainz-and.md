> The BBC selects MusicBrainz as its new music metadata provider and incorporates MusicBrainz data into its music website at [bbc.co.uk/music](http://bbc.co.uk/music). For all the details on this announcement, please see our [press release](http://metabrainz.org/news/pressrelease/MetaBrainzPressRelease_20070628.html).

I'm a former board member of and supporter of MusicBrainz/MetaBrainz. It's to CDDB as Firefox is to IE. (Although it does a bunch of other stuff too...) This deal with the BBC is a big win and an important step in becoming ubiquitous in the main stream. Congrats guys!
