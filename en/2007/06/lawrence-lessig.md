During Larry's talk at the iCommons Summit he talked about shifting his focus from IP related stuff to fighting corruption. Some took that to mean that he would be abandoning the "movement" but Larry describes in a blog post that he's not leaving us, but rather shifting his focus. He will continue to work on Creative Commons, but his public and academic will shift. [Please read his post for the nuance and the specifics.](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/003800.shtml)
