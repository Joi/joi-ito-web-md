At [LeWeb3](http://www.leweb3.com/), [Dopplr](http://www.dopplr.com/) announced ([the release](http://blog.dopplr.com/index.php/2007/12/11/dopplr-launches-at-leweb3-in-paris/)) that they have officially launched and are now open for registration without invitations. [BBC did a nice story.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7139175.stm)

Dopplr is currently my primary way of figuring out where I can meet friends coincidentally because it allows me to track where my travels overlap with my friends.

The only problem is that I can’t yet mark what days I’m busy so all of the extra opportunities to meet often stress my already busy scheduling. Personally, I think the net result is that we have more informed choices and opportunity, but we have to build the tools and the social norms for all of this, just like we’re having to develop them for the always-on mobile Internet.

PS I’m an investor in Dopplr.
