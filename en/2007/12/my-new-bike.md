When I read that Zack Rosen and his friends were [starting a bike business](http://www.zacker.org/mission_bicycles), I ordered one right away. The basic configuration was $790, but I upgraded the headset and crank and paid $850, which seems pretty reasonable. Zack is an old friend and a cool guy and I knew that a bike he was working on would be special. I wasn't disappointed. I went to their web design studio/bike assembly area and picked up my new bike and rode it back to the hotel today. What a treat.

They're called [Mission Bicycles](http://missionbicycle.com/) and they are open for business now and taking orders. I've only taken my around for a few miles so far, but I love it.

UPDATE: If you see Shawn Fanning riding around on this bike, he didn't steal it. I stashed it at the [Rupture](http://rupture.com/) offices.
