As you’ll see in this video, there has been important progress in making Wikipedia compatible with the world of [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) licensed work. But we should be very precise about this extremely good news: As Jimmy announces, the [Wikimedia Foundation Board](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation) has agreed with a proposal made by the Free Software Foundation that will permit Wikipedia (and other such wikis) to relicense under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license](http://http//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

That is very different from saying that Wikipedia has relicensed under a CC license. The decision whether to take advantage of this freedom granted by the FSF when the FSF grants it will be a decision the Wikipedia community will have to make. We are very hopeful that the community will ratify this move to compatible freedoms. And if they do, we are looking forward to an extraordinary celebration.

Read the Wikimedia Foundation resolution [here](http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:License_update).

My endless thanks to everyone who has helped make this possible, from Richard Stallman and the FSF board, to the important leaders within the Wikipedia community who say yet another legal obstacle to freedom that they could remove. Thanks to everyone who has been working on it. This is a very significant step in improving interoperability and I think this is a great example of how we can all work together to benefit the free culture community. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
