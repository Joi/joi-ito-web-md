> [From the Why-a-GC-from-Cravath-is-great Department: The lawsuit is over](http://lessig.org/blog/2007/11/from_the_whyagcfromcravathisgr.html)

We received this happy missive in the mail yesterday: The plaintiffs in the [lawsuit about Virgin using a CC-licensed photo](http://lessig.org/blog/2007/09/on_the_texas_suit_against_virg.html) have dismissed CC from the case. This is not a settlement. It is not the product of negotiation. It is the recognition by plaintiffs counsel that the laws of Texas and the United States give the plaintiffs no cause to sue Creative Commons.This is great news. Congratulations to the whole team who worked on this including a number of volunteers from the community.
