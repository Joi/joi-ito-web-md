[iCommons is doing a fundraising auction.](http://icommons.org/auction) There are lots of cool things that you can bid on and help iCommons at the same time. My contribution are some photographs.
> A set of five photographs from Joi Ito's Flickr collection, showing nature and landscape portraits from Japan.

Apart from being the chairman of the board of Creative Commons and a member of the board of iCommons, Joi Ito is an avid photographer. In this collection he shoots a Shinkansen station in Yamagata, a view of Shanghai from the JW Marriot, a bamboo thicket from his yard and detail of dragonfly wings.[You can bid on my photos here.](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=360001773843) My apologies for the delay in blogging this, but you only have one more day. ;-)
