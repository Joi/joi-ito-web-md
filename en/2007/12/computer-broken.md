My computer broke when I was messing with it on the plane. The good news is that I think I can recover most of the data. The bad news is that I don't have a computer for the next two or three days until Fumi/Mika bring my backup computer to SF and I go there from here (Paris).

I also stupidly don't remember the password for my main mail account (it is encrypted on my computer) so can only retrieve email sporadically on my iPhone from my main account. If you need to reach me urgently, please SMS me and/or send email to joiito at gmail where I will be sending my web mail from.

I can't believe that I literally had my backup disk in my hand and decided not to pack it because I had too much stuff to carry this trip... \*sigh\*
