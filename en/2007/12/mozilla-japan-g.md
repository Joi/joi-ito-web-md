Mozilla Japan is currently running the [Get Firefox Video Awards](http://getfirefox.jp/video/) event, an online promotion for Firefox where over 100 Japanese video artists and animators have created some [amazing videos](http://getfirefox.jp/video/gallery/) to promote Firefox within 30 seconds. This is similar to the [Firefox Flicks](http://www.firefoxflicks.com/) contest from a few years ago. I am one of the judges along with Hiroyuki Nakano, Chiaki Hayashi, Andrew Thomas and Chibi Takita of Mozilla Japan. The party to announce the winners of this event will be on Tuesday, December 18th in Tokyo at [Super-Deluxe](http://www.super-deluxe.com/), starting at 19:30. The event is free and should be a lot of fun. Not sure if I can make the event myself but it should be a great event and I hope you can go to support some wonderful Japanese artists and creators. Registration for the event is at the home page of the [Get Firefox Video Awards](http://getfirefox.jp/video/).
