[Pat](http://www.vignetted.com/) recommended I try to [Pclix](https://www.pclix.com/shopping/shopexd.asp?id=1) for time-lapse. Just recorded dinner in our living room using my Canon 5D. Pretty interesting effect. Now to find something more interesting to shoot.

UPDATE: Put together a day's worth of time-lapse with Wataridori 2 by Cornelius. [(29 MB mp4)](http://media.ito.com/timelapse/aday.mp4)
