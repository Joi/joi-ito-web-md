[![Pierre Omidyar](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/194/498701092_8c23e60e82_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/498701092/ "Photo Sharing")

Good news. Pierre made BusinessWeek's list of [Entrepreneurs for the Ages](http://images.businessweek.com/ss/07/06/0628_greatest_entp/index_01.htm). Congrats Pierre! And... they used my photo of him. Yay!

Bad news. They didn't give me attribution. It's the ONLY thing I ask people do with my photos since they're [Creative Commons Attribution licensed](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/). It doesn't cost them anything... and they're crediting the photos by Getty Images.

/me shakes fist at BusinessWeek

The original Flickr image is here:

I suppose they might have found it on [Pierre's Wikipedia article.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Omidyar) But... clicking on the photo shows the license.

UPDATE: I wrote them a letter and they sent me an apology and fixed article. Thanks BusinessWeek!
