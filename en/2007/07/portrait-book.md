I've been musing about putting together a book of photos or something and have been experimenting with various printing services like Lulu. Recently [Carl Malamud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Malamud) pushed me to go forward with this idea. I decided that instead of waiting getting some sort of final book thing, I'd start by just posting Flickr portraits on this blog and writing blurbs about the people in a [new "people" category](http://joi.ito.com/archives/people/) on my blog.

Later, I can decide whether this ends up in something worthy of a book. I've been contributing my photos to people's Wikipedia entries, but I think this form allows me to be a bit more personal about what I can say about the people and provides the reader with the PoV that is absent by design in Wikipedia.

Also, if I do ever end up putting together a book, I might include things the comments so feel free to post things you think might be good to add on that person's page. Also, I guarantee that the book will be [CC BY licensed](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) and available for download as well. Of course it will be available here as it unfolds.

Hopefully, this new project will help me get back into tending for my blog. ;-)
