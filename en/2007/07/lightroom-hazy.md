Jet lag woke me up again at 3AM so I watched the [Adobe Lightroom stuff on Lynda](http://lynda.com/). I learned how to control more things in post-processing so I went out into the foggy and hazy sunrise to take some photos in the yard to play with in Lightroom. I still have a lot to learn, but I think I have a better handle on how to deal with overcast lighting... Which is good since it's rainy season in Japan right now and overcast a lot.

I also learned how to fix [chromatic aberration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_Aberration) which I used today on [one of the images](http://flickr.com/photos/joi/729943853/in/photostream/).

I thought about whether I should go back to a more journal-like form for my blog or start writing more stuff on Flickr. I seem to be spending more time responding to comments on Flickr these days than on this blog. I suppose my online presence needs an overhaul.
