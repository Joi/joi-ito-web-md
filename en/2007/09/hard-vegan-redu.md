Eight months since I started my vegan diet, I still feel much healthier than when I started, but with more alcohol, bread, pasta, rice and salt, I've slipped off the wagon a bit. I'm meditating less, exercising less, regained about 25% of the total weight I lost and don't have the euphoria that I had at the beginning.
So as of today, [I'm going to do the Eat to Live six week detox plan again.](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/12/24/etl_diet_update.html) Basically the same vegan diet I'm on right now, but no salt, refined grains, alcohol or oils.
See you on the other side. ;-)
