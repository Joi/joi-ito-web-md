Other than being 7 degrees celcius and raining most of the time, Ars Electronica this year was a lot of fun. It was packed full of work for me this week with five talks and ten media interviews, but with Sandra, Elizabeth and Fumi's help, everything went smoothly and I survived. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to see all of the installations or talk to as many artists as I would have liked, but I had more than enough interesting conversations to make it great.

I went to Ars Electronica this year together with the MOGA unit which is a collaboration between Professor Inakage's lab, Joi's lab (mostly Fumi) and Hiroyuki Nakano's Peacedelic team. [MOGA set up the "Jump" installation in Linz.](http://www.aec.at/en/festival2007/program/project.asp?iProjectID=14095) [Yuichiro Katsumoto, also from Professor Inakage's lab presented Amagatana.](http://www.aec.at/en/festival2007/program/project.asp?iProjectID=14090#) It was fun seeing the students I had been working with in the Ars Electronica context.

I think that most of the talks will end up online somewhere, but I'm not sure where. ;-) [I did see one video interview on Artivi.com.](http://www.artivi.com/encounters/joichi.php)

The theme of this year's Ars Electronica was privacy.

[The first session I participated in was with the Austrian Association and Judges and members from the Ars Electronica community.](http://www.aec.at/en/festival2007/program/project.asp?iProjectID=13986) I talked broadly about the generation gap and the how the behavior and use of the technology was very different among the new users of the Internet and how difficult it was, yet how important it was, for the older generation to try to understand the way the new generation used the new medium. I was really impressed in the conversations with some of the judges and how forward looking they were. I also talked about the importance of Global Voices in the future of global democracy. I suppose that federal judges can think more long term about democracy and things like the cost of privacy than their politician brothers. [Having smart judges is a great thing as the recent ruling by the 10th Circuit Court in the US shows.](http://lessig.org/blog/2007/09/a_big_victory_golan_v_gonzales.html)

Summer Watson

[The second session I participated in was a discussion about future trends with some of corporate executives.](http://www.cscout.com/blog/2007/08/28/event-the-future-tour-experience-the-trends-at-ars-electronica.html) It was a good group with a number of interesting presentation. The presentation that was the most interesting to me was Summer Watson, a British soprano opera singer, who announced that she is going to ski the last degree (from 89 to 90) of the North Pole and sing an Aria at the North pole as a call to action on environmental issues.

I had coffee with her afterwards and we talked a lot about Creative Commons and online identities and was inspired to start the [Summer Watson Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Watson).

I also did a session about WoW which I think you can imagine without me going into too much detail.

Volker Grassmuck

[I did a session with Leonard Dobusch to talk about importance of Free Networks and Free Knowledge.](http://www.aec.at/en/festival2007/program/project.asp?iProjectID=14077) Again, I'm sure readers of this blog can imagine what my position was. Leonard, who is also the son of the Mayor of Linz, had some interesting perspectives on the role of municipal governments in supporting public access. He had co-edited a book recently where they discussed many of these issues. He cited an article by Volker Grassmuck where Volker argued that having a public space for hosting content on the web was important.

[Finally, I was on a panel as part of a awards ceremony and a kick-off meeting for Fair Music.](http://www.aec.at/en/festival2007/program/project.asp?iProjectID=14041) The idea behind Fair Music was sort of a music parallel for the Fair Trade mark. Whereas the Fair Trade mark tries to identify products where the production meets basic Fair Trade parameters and requirements, Fair Music marks were awarded to companies and projects where the artists and consumers were treated fairly. Fair in this context means a number of things including the artist receiving a fair share of the remuneration or the project promoting diversity against the bias of "Northern" dominance in the music business.

I mostly talked about the need for new business models and the role of Creative Commons in this context.
