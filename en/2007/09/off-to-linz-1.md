Although I still haven't decided which camera to take with me, I'll be leaving for Linz in a few hours to attend the [Ars Electronica Festival](http://www.aec.at/en/festival2007/). According to [my bio page on the site](http://www.aec.at/en/personen_page.asp?iPersonID=16), this is the 10th year that I've participated. Most years I've gone twice - once for the jury and once for the festival. I think that makes Linz the city I've visited the most in Europe.

I love Ars Electronica and all of the people involved and I'm excited to going back after missing last year. I'll be giving a few talks and will be on a number of panels. [A few of them are linked from the speaker page](http://www.aec.at/en/festival2007/program/allartists.asp?label=I). Otherwise I will probably be wandering the installations and the talks with my camera.

See you there!
