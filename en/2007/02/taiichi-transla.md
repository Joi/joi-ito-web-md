Taiichi Fox, who [let me ride his Segway back in 2003](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/25/my_first_segway_ride.html), has [started translating my English language blog posts into Japanese](http://joi.ito.com/jp/archives/2007/02/10/004441.html). It is somewhat embarrassing that I can't write well in Japanese, and I am EXTREMELY grateful for Taiichi's support. Thanks!
