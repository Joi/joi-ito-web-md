The [Emergent Democracy article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_democracy) on Wikipedia has been flagged for deletion. "The article may be deleted if this message remains in place for five days.Prod, concern: WP:NEO and WP:COI This template was added 2007-02-02; five days from then is 2007-02-07." The neutrality is disputed and also is being accused of [conflict of interest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:COI) and [neologisms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NEO). If you have have an interest in helping keep this article, please contribute to the [talk page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Emergent_democracy) or help improve [the article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_democracy). I think more citations would help.
