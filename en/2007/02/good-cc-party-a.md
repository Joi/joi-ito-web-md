I'll blog more of the upcoming events that I'll be attending at SXSW, but here's an important one.
> **CHALLENGE**  
> We challenge you, our community, to raise $6000 for Creative Commons by subscribing to [GOOD Magazine](http://www.goodmagazine.com/) and having a drink with us at the famed [South by Southwest (SXSW)](http://www.sxsw.com) conference in Austin, TX. All it takes is for 200 people over the next 2 weeks to [subscribe](http://www.goodmagazine.com/choosegood/creativecommons) to GOOD. No, my math skills are not wrong. If you subscribe in the next 2 weeks your $20 bucks will be generously matched by [Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com) for up to $2000. So you won't just raise $4000 for CC but $6000.

**DETAILS**  
Since July 2006, Creative Commons has been one of the [12 non-profits](http://www.goodmagazine.com/subscribe) benefitting from the Choose GOOD campaign. GOOD magazine was started by some innovative people who have taken a non-traditional approach to promoting their magazine - and have experienced unbelievable success. The folks at GOOD have been traveling around the nation hosting [parties](http://www.flickr.com/photos/goodmagazine/sets/) and more importantly raising money and awareness for the non-profits that they support.

Over the past 7 months they have sold 11,899 subscriptions generating over $200,000 which in turn is gifted to 12 non-profits that are doing new, innovative, and great things. CC is one of them and since July GOOD has raised over $11,000 for us!

We need your help to make [GOOD Magazine's SXSW party](http://www.goodmagazine.com/fieldwork/sxsw_good_party1) honoring Creative Commons the most successful party they've hosted to date. Cover charge is the $20 subscription fee and we strongly suggest emailing your rsvp to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

If you want to help support CC and attend one of [GOOD's infamous parties](http://www.flickr.com/photos/goodmagazine/sets/) but do not reside in the Austin, TX area don't worry - your subscription fee gets you into any of the upcoming GOOD parties. And yes all parties are open bar.

By subscribing to this awesome new magazine you gain entrance to the biggest GOOD/SXSW party to date and you're helping us raise $6000 for CC. That money will support what we continue to do best - enable a participatory culture.
