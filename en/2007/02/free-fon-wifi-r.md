FON has trialed giving away free Wi-Fi routers in other regions and is now [giving them away](http://fon.com/gigaom/) in the US together with [GigaOM](http://gigaom.com/2007/01/31/giveaway-thursday-fon-wi-fi-routers-joost-and-some-babelgum/). Basically, this gets you a free FON router which you can use to register as a Fonero. This, in turn, allows you to access any FON access point for free.
