I'll be in SF tomorrow and will at the CC Salon. Come by if you have time. [Here's the Eventful listing](http://eventful.com/events/E0-001-002982450-7). Here's the info from the CC Weblog:
> [Creative Commons Salon SF Next Wednesday: Joi, John, Heather and Jim](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7242)

Please join us for the first C[C Salon of 2007 at ShineSF.com on Wednesday, February 21, from 7-9 PM in San Francisco](http://upcoming.org/event/137741). It will be major! And, yes, please note, we are not doing this event monthly now, but every other month to maximize the impact in SF!

The line-up for the evening:

\* [John Wilbanks](http://creativecommons.org/about/people#34), Executive Director, [Science Commons](http://sciencecommons.org/)  
\* [Joi Ito](http://joi.ito.com/), Web Entrepreneur, Chairman of Creative Commons Board  
\* Heather Ford, Executive Director, [iCommons](http://icommons.org/)  
\* Jim Sowers, [Calabash Music](http://calabashmusic.com/) and [National Geographic](http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/), Musical Guest, Discussing state of Digital Music and DJ’ing

Details

The event is free and open to the public. Quick presentations begin at 7 PM and go until 9 PM, but if you’d like to have an informal meeting or get a good seat, get there a bit early (We open the doors at 6 PM). So don’t worry if you’re late; there will be stuff happening all night at Shine, [1337 Mission Street between 9th and 10th Streets](http://upcoming.org/venue/17984/). [Shine](http://shinesf.com/) has free wi-fi and a super cool [Flickr](http://flickr.com/) photo booth. Note: Since Shine is a bar, CC Salon is only open to people who are 21 and older.

Also, plug this event into your digital life on [our upcoming.org posting](http://upcoming.org/event/137741).
