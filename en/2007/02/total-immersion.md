[Seth](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) sent me a DVD of Total Immersion swimming ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Immersion) / [Official Site](http://www.totalimmersion.net/)) and I tried some of the drills in it for the first time last night. (Thanks Seth!) It appears to be a unique way of helping swimmers to learn balance, drag reduction and timing through a new approach to learning and thinking about your stroke/style. Some of the drills were difficult for me, but I could tell that it was because my balance was not "natural" yet. It was rather frustrating "starting from scratch" but I'm definitely going to give this a try and see how much my swimming improves. I have a feeling that this rather focused and peaceful style of swimming will suit some of the experiments in meditation that I want to conduct.
