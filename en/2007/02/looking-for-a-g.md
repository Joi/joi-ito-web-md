It is with sadness that I post that we’re looking for a new General Counsel at Creative Commons. After two fantastic years at the legal helm, our current GC, [Mia Garlick](http://creativecommons.org/about/people#36), like the GC before her, [Glenn Brown](http://creativecommons.org/about/alumni#10), has been snatched up by the Google Monster. (It’s a nice monster, but very lawyer-hungry).

This is a insanely cool job, though of course, for only non-profit pay. But for anyone eager to move into a more interesting, remake-the-world kind of practice, check out the [description on the CC site](http://creativecommons.org/about/opportunities#gc)./me shakes fist at Google Monster. ;-)
