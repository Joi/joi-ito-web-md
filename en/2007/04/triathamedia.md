Breaking the 10% rule...  
[Chart from Nike](http://www.nike.com/nikeplus/)

Partly because I've always wanted to try a mini-[Triathlon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon) and partly because I'm beginning to get minor wear and tear on my body from exercising every day, I've started cycling, swimming and running. It's easier to follow the 10% rule that way too. (Don't increase your exercise routine more than 10% a week.)

My current exercise media of choice for the 3 are:

**Running** - [Podrunner](http://djsteveboy.com/podrunner.html) with Nike+ and iPod Nano (just donated to Podrunner)  
**Swimming** - Ambient music on my [SwiMP3](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2007/03/23/swimp3.html) (taking a rest while my shoulder repairs)  
**Cycling** (Stationary) - [Lost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_%28TV_series%29), [24](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_%28TV_series%29) and other TV episodes and videos on iPod Video.
