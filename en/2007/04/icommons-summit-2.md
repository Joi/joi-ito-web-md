We really need your help on this.
> Two years ago, iCommons established the yearly iSummit conference as a way to bring together the thinkers, innovators, and pioneers of the "Open" movement.

This year's [iSummit](http://icommons.org/isummit-07/about-the-summit/) (taking place in Dubrovnik, Croatia from June 15th through 17th) will bring together more than 250 key players for two days of intense discussion and debate about our digital freedoms and the future of the Internet. It is critical to assure that a truly global legal perspective is represented at this important conference.  
 [Creative Commons International affiliates](http://creativecommons.org/worldwide) are crucial to the success of the iSummit and of Creative Commons globally. The iSummit is the one opportunity each year for these dedicated volunteers drawn from universities and cultural institutes to learn from each other face to face and plan for the challenges and opportunities facing the movement in the next year. Enabling these volunteers to participate in the iSummit is truly the most leveraged way to support Creative Commons at this time.

In order for Creative Commons to provide affiliates with scholarships to attend this critical conference, we need your help in raising $50,000 within the next two weeks. This is a daunting task, but we strongly believe that you, our community, will help us reach this goal.

Please [give](http://creativecommons.org/support) to the fund. All of our usual [cool premiums](http://support.creativecommons.org/donate) are available.

To help, [Digital Garage](http://www.garage.co.jp/en/index.html), a major sponsor of [iSummit 2006](http://www.icommons.org/isummit/), is matching the first $20,000 that is contributed.

This campaign will end when we have raised $50,000, or in two weeks, whichever comes first. There will be updates from our international affiliates blogged each day of the [campaign](http://support.creativecommons.org/).

If your company is interested in contributing matching funds or if you have questions about the campaign, please contact our Development Coordinator, Melissa Reeder, at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
