I'm about half-way through [The Heart of Buddha's Teaching](http://joi.vox.com/library/book/6a00b8ea06af90dece00cd972488294cd5.html) by Thich Nhat Hanh who wrote the book The Miracle of Mindfulness by Thich Nhat Hanh that [I wrote about a little while ago.](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2007/04/12/mindfulness_and_deferred_yak_shaving.html) So far it's a wonderful book that describes Buddhism broadly but also brings it down to earth very specifically.

The chapter on "Right Speech" starts with this description of Right Speech.
> Forth Mindfulness Training
>
> Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful speech and the inability to listen to others, I am committed to cultivating loving speech and deep listening in order to bring joy and happiness to others and relieve others of their suffering. Knowing that words can create happiness or suffering, I am determined to speak truthfully, with words that inspire self-confidence, joy, and hope. I will not spread news that I do not know to be certain and will not criticize or condemn things of which I am not sure. I will refrain from uttering words that can cause division or discord, or that can cause the family or the community to break. I am determined to make all efforts to reconcile and resolve all conflicts, however small.

I don't think anyone should be forced to follow this code and I'm not suggesting that it become a bloggers code or anything. I just find that it resonates with my personal philosophy that is evolving over time.

In this context, I now regret the tone in which I wrote the [whiny post about the W Hotel not wanting to store a bike for me.](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2007/04/19/bike_shop_in_soma_alternative_to_the_w_hotel_san_francisco.html) I was frustrated and annoyed and wrote something that was probably somewhat cruel considering no one was really at fault. After I posted that note, I sent the link to the W. I got a call from someone responsible there who apologized to me. I realized that I really didn't need an apology and what I really wanted was for them to try to improve generally if possible. I really didn't feel good having made someone feel bad, but since I wrote that post in a somewhat cruel way, it probably did make people feel bad.

Anyway, I'm not trying to become a buddhist monk or anything, but possibly because of my new rather non-violent diet, I'm feeling more and more at peace and less and less happy about any cruelty or un-mindful actions on my part and regret silly things like that whiny post.
