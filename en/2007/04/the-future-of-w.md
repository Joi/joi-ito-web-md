![Web20Mirai Cover-1](http://joi.ito.com/web20mirai_cover-1.jpg)

Impress, a Japanese publisher, just released a Mook (magazine/book) called [The Future of Web 2.0 - The Sharing Economy](http://www.impressrd.jp/web2mirai/) based on presentations at the [Digital Garage New Context Conference](http://www.garage.co.jp/ncc2006/) last year in Tokyo. The book is in Japanese. There are excerpts from presentations by Mitchell Baker, John Buckman, Tantek Çelik, David Isenberg, Lawrence Lessig, Jun Murai, Hiroyuki Nakano and Cory Ondrejka. I've got some words in it including a translation of my DBA thesis proposal. (I really do need to work on this more...)

A really cool thing about this is that Impress has decided to release this mook under [CC BY-NC (v 2.1 Japan)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.1/jp/). They have also made a PDF versions of each section available for download simultaneously under the same license [on their site](http://www.impressrd.jp/web2mirai/).
