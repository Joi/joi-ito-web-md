[Lessig has a thoughtful post urging people to urge the RNC and DNC not to use restrictive copyrights on political debates](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/003755.shtml). With more and more political expression being done in video, it is time we consider the importance of free speech in video. Video is covered by stronger copyright restrictions when it comes to citation and remix than text. Having politicians and political parties push networks to air their words under the most permissive CC license, the [CC-BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license would greatly enhance the public's ability to participate in the political video dialog.

UPDATE: [Lessig has an update](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/003760.shtml) with the crazy rules that NBC uses today for reuse of debate footage.
