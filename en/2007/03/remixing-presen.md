As I sit here and put together my presentation for today, I'm reminded of the days when I used to spin records in nightclubs. First, I try to figure out who the audience is. Then I try to figure out generally what I want to say. After that, I pick up my favorite songs or groups of songs and throw them into the box. (In the case of my presentation, it is arguments, videos and images.) Then I try to figure out what stays, what order they should be presented and how the transitions between the different elements should work.

Anyway... back to work on my presentation.
