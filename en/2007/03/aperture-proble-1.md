Ever since the OS X update, Aperture keeps crashing. Bah!
> Mar 16 15:52:09 joi crashdump[4663]: Aperture crashed

I reinstalled it and ran a bunch of disk/directory repairs, but no go. I'm switching to Adobe Bridge.

UPDATE: Someone at Apple just told me that the patch I made to the system to get it to do M8 RAW is probably the problem causing the crashing. They also told me that Apple is working on M8 RAW support. Stay tuned!
