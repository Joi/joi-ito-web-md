Just saw the Tesla coil music demo at [Dorkbot at SXSW](http://upcoming.org/event/154446/). It was amazing. I'm not sure exactly how the technology works, but hey use a computer to control the frequency of a tesla coil so it "plays" music. This image was taken while the coils were playing the theme from Ghost Busters.
