Jonkichi my mage hit Level 70 this weekend. Just updated my [Rupture profile for Jonkichi](http://www.rupture.com/characters/US/Eitrigg/Jonkichi). The grind from 60 to 70 was relatively fun and I enjoyed the new content. I'm also really enjoying my flying mount, although I can't afford an epic one yet.

As you can see [in my gear list](http://www.rupture.com/characters/US/Eitrigg/Jonkichi/gear), I'm still wearing my T2 hat from Onyxia, but have replaced just about everything else.
