Austin Hilton Pool at 5:30AM

I have not been swimming for over a week because I injured my shoulder while trying to win a battle with the water. Although the stationary bike has been interesting and used muscles that were surprised by the sudden call to arms, I've missed my swimming.

When I checked into the [Austin Hilton](http://beta.plazes.com/plaze/33cf60ba027ee6f61d63aa2a02a91a34/), I notice some sign saying "[heated pool](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/418768462/)". I also noticed that it was open from 5:30AM. This morning, some remnant jet lag from some trip woke me up at 5AM. It looked chilly, dark and wet outside, but the idea of swimming in a heated pool in this weather appealed to me in an [avantouinti](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/02/16/wonderful_avantouinti.html) sort of way. ([Marko](http://about.blyk.com/team/?name=ahtisaari) turned me on to avantouinti and now I'm a convert.)

As I sat in the whirlpool warming up and doing some stretching, [Matt](http://flickr.com/photos/joi/403101153/)'s voice and the [Total Immersion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Immersion) images from the DVD that [Seth](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) sent me filled my mind. I rigged up my goggles with the [Dolphin mp3 player](http://www.engadget.com/2007/02/20/centurys-dolphin-waterproof-mp3-player/) that [Pete](http://www.petebarrwatson.com/) suggested on my [music in the water](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2007/01/10/music_in_the_water.html) post. (I tried ordering the [Kiefer SwiMP3](http://www.kiefer.com/Kiefer/productr.asp?pf%5Fid=600386&gift=False&HSLB=False&mscssid=05F9964DE74F46D680DA56C9A8777A1C), but wasn't able to get it. I just re-ordered it from someone on eBay after [Austin](http://twitter.com/austinhill) told me on Twitter that he got one there.)

Anyway, it all came together for me today. While [The Orb](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Orb/+wiki) from [Jeff](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/09/10/chicago_smart_bar.html)'s playlist set the tone with the sounds of pink fluffy clouds, I was able to make peace with the water. The flip turn that I had been struggling with seemed to come naturally - Matt's tips coming to mind as I made each turn. The "swim like a fish" images from Total Immersion helped me pace myself and swim without feeling out of breath. It felt very peaceful and it felt like I had made peace with the water.

I finished up with with a short session of my attempt at the Maha Mudra and Pranayama that [Jay](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/04/11/my_hero_jay_dvivedi_the_ubercio_of_shinsei_bank.html) is teaching me. I had the steam room in the deserted locker-room all to myself.

Clearly, I have much to learn and my swimming stroke is still crap, but I felt like I had hit a milestone of sorts. As I sat down to write this post, I realized how much this journey is result of the amazing support of my friends starting with [Shawn](http://www.rupture.com/characters/US/Mug%27thol/Napster)'s advice to try a vegan diet. Thanks everyone.
