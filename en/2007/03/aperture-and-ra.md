Does anyone use Aperture and RAW images? I'm having trouble. I've downloaded and installed the RAW update, but it doesn't seem like Aperture recognizes the [RAW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAW_image_format) [DNG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Negative_Specification) files from my Leica DIGITAL-MODUL-R. My Adobe Bridge deals with them fine. Any ideas? Thanks in advance for any advice.
