At GDC, [Ian Bogost](http://www.persuasivegames.com) and I were geeking out about the Leica M8. He showed me his M8 and the amazing leather case he had for it. Later I asked him to refer me to his source. There is a guy named Luigi Crescenzi in Italy that makes them. You email Luigi via the [somewhat crazy looking website](http://www.leicatime.com/). He took my order immediately and I got it a few days later. I've been sporting it for a few days now and I'm in otaku bliss. The case is really great and has that special handmade loving workmanship thing that really gets me going. It reminds me a bit of some scene from [Pattern Recognition](http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-William-Gibson/dp/0425198685/).

Following Ian's example, I've started reading and posting to the [Leica forums](http://www.leica-camera-user.com/), the mother-lode of Leica otaku madness.

I sort of knew this, but it's clear now. Leicaism isn't really about wanting a "better" camera. It's an excessive obsessive syndrome.
