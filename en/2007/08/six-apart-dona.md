First of all, THANKS to Six Apart and the community of users for the support. Creative Commons and WITNESS can really use the money and we appreciate it VERY much. A portion of the donations by users for permanent Live Journal accounts was donated to [RAINN](http://www.rainn.org/), [EFF](http://www.eff.org/), [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) and [WITNESS](http://www.witness.org/) during a [recent campaign](http://news.livejournal.com/100876.html).

Unfortunately, we failed to disclose my involvement in Creative Commons and WITNESS when Six Apart was conducting the campaign. I'm the chairman of Creative Commons and a board member of WITNESS. I apologize to everyone for this oversight. I think that transparency is an essential part of everything we stand for and it really is unfortunate that we didn't handle this properly.

I would like to make it clear that while I donate time and money to WITNESS and Creative Commons, I pay all of my expenses and have never charged anything to either of these organizations... so while it doesn't make the lack of disclosure OK, I don't personally benefit financially from either of these donations from Six Apart.

Anyway, thanks again for everyone's support of Six Apart, Creative Commons, WITNESS and other organizations that I love.

BTW, [Valleywag posted about the lack of disclosure.](http://valleywag.com/tech/conflicts-of-interest/six-apart-funnels-donations-to-backers-pet-charities-286534.php)

UPDATE: BTW, [my wiki profile](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?joi_ito) probably is the best list of affiliations that I have if you're interested.
