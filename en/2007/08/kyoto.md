Just got back from visiting Kyoto with Reid, Michelle and Mizuka.

[Posted some photos to a Flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/sets/72157601784731211/). Also posted a short chat with Reid about venture business in China and Japan in [mp3 (8.9 MB)](http://dav.ito.com/joi/reidjoi.mp3) and [ogg (15.3 MB)](http://dav.ito.com/joi/reidjoi.ogg) formats.
