We did another photo walk the other day. This time we wandered around Shibuya. I just realized that I didn’t blog about it. I [posted my set to Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/sets/72157603095536166/) and you can see the images of the rest of the photographers [tagged with ccphotowalk071111](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/ccphotowalk071111/). Thanks to everyone who participated and special thanks to Fumi and Mika for organizing everything.
