Bill Tai turned me on to the SliMP3 Ethernet MP3 Player made by [Slim Devices Inc.](http://www.slimdevices.com/) It's $249 device that talks to a server installed on your PC via ethernet. It has a remote control that lets you navigate through the mp3's on your PC and plays them out through RCA cables that connect to your stereo. Pretty cool device which works well. I don't know if $249 is expensive or not, but in my house where my PC is in a room in the basement and my stereo is in my living room, it's a great thing. Setup and installation were easy as cake. The device talks DHCP so you literally just plug and play. I'm all for dedicated devices that make hooking up stuff in the living room easier!
