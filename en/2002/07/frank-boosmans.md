Frank, who told me, ["Oh No. Now all you'll be thinking about is whether something will be material for your blog,"](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/000130.html#000130) when I told him about my blog, has started [his own blog](http://www.boosman.com/blog/2002_06_01_blogarchive.html#85208506). I met Frank through our mutual friend Hiroshi Lockheimer when they both worked for [Be Inc.](http://www.beincorporated.com/) Frank was in charge of marketing and communications and they asked me to be on Be's advisory board. I was the first and last advisory board member I think. Anyway, since then we've kept in touch and Frank co-founded [AirEight](http://www.aireight.com/) with his old pals from Vertus. I'm on the advisory board for AirEight as well. Looking at the web page, you might think that all they do is sponsor race cars, but they are actually doing some cool things. ;-)

Frank has a very geeky style that is really my favorite part of the US technology entrepreneurship thing, but he [seems to feel a bit self-conscious about it.](http://www.boosman.com/blog/2002_06_01_blogarchive.html#85208506) Another mutual friend we have is Michael Backes who David Smith describes as the only person he knows with terminal [ADD](http://www.add.org/). They both worked at Virtus. There something about people who worked at Virtus that I can't put my finger on... They are all have kind of a wacky sense of humor and seem to be part of some big long drama that reminds me of the [Hitch Hicker's Guide to the Galaxy](http://www.douglasadams.com/) or something.

Anyway, [Frank's blog](http://www.boosman.com/blog/) should be fun. I look forward to tracking it. You saw it here first. My first scoop. I blogged a blog first.
