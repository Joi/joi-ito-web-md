I'm on my way to Aspen today to attend Fortune's Brainstorm 2002. [There is the list of people who attended last year on the Fortune web page](http://www.fortune.com/sitelets/newfuture/newfuture_people.html). [There is also a web page about what they discussed last year.](http://www.fortune.com/sitelets/newfuture/newfuture.html)
  
  
I am supposed to prepare a 3 minute "brainscan" blurb.
  
  
Hmm... I think I'll talk about the imact of digital communications on media, the public, the economy, security and the sovereignty of nations or something. I think people are sick of hearing New Economy crap, but I think that people have overestimated and short term impact and underestimated the long term impact. I think change is still to come... Or maybe I'll talk about my blog. ;-p
  
  
I'm also on the China panel. I know so little about China. I talked to Leonard again at length yesterday about his thoughts. (Leonard is the CEO of ASE, the second largest semiconductor packaging and testing company in Taiwan and former CEO of Acer.) Leonard had a great perspective about Taiwan, China, outsourcing and the future of Japan. I think that there is a huge risk that Japan falls between the manufacturing and services cracks and becomes an insignificant player in the global economy. I think that is what I should focus my comments on...
  
  
Anyway, I don't know what the rules are about writing about the conference, but depending on how open they are, I'll try to blog the good bits.
  
  
*I wish Fortune would get rid of those annoying "subscribe here" pop-ups ad windows on their site. They are exactly as annoying as those subscription inserts that fall out of paper magazines.*
