So it is a fight to be the most simple? Goggle beat Infoseek by being more simple and user oriented. Web services take that to the next level. If companies start competing to be easier to integrate, more open and more simple that's a great thing for us!
  
  
Quoted from the [Goggle Weblog](http://google.blogspace.com/):

> [Amazon Light](http://www.kokogiak.com/amazon), a very cool new use of the [Amazon Web Services](http://www.amazon.com/webservices/) recently introuced (and clearly inspired by Google's Web API) provides a cleaner-than-Amazon interface to the same data. However, they recently report that [they've been asked to cease-and-desist by Google's lawyers](http://www.kokogiak.com/amazon/about.asp). The site was very much like Google's ([screenshot](http://www.kokogiak.com/amazon/notgoogle.gif)) but it was clearly in good taste. I'm not sure why Google is so testy about it. Is a books.google.com coming soon?
