[If you haven't seen this, it's a great site](http://www.theyrule.net/). We gave it a Golden Nica this year at the [Prix Ars Electronica](http://www.aec.at/festival2002/content.asp?lang=e).

From the [Prix Ars Electronica web page](http://prixars.aec.at/2002/):

> Database visualization is an important area of interactive design. "They Rule" is an excellent example of this kind of project. It attempts to demonstrate the relationships between some of America's most powerful corporate executives by visually showing you which companies they are involved with, and how these companies might gain from such a relationship.*

The interface, once you get it, is pretty easy. There was a map of the [Trilateral Commission](http://www.trilateral.org/), it's members and the boards that they sit on. [(Here is a speech I gave at the Trilateral)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/000259.html). You can see all of the board members of a company, other boards they sit on, donations they have made, all mined from public sources presented in an elegant design.
