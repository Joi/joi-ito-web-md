Bloggers will already be aware of this, but web publishers are trying to make it illegal to link to pages on their site. The logic from some people is that it subverts the efforts of the publisher to manage the traffic, sell advertising and control the user. [National Public Radio](http://www.npr.org/) say that they just wanted to know who was using their stuff. The great debate following their taking this position seems to have changed their minds. The form one had to fill out in order to link to their page is no longer online and one day after the [OJR article](http://www.ojr.org/ojr/kramer/p1025044888.php), June 27, NPR updated their [Terms of Use Page](http://www.npr.org/about/termsofuse.html) which now says this about linking:  
> ***Links to NPR Web Sites**  
> NPR encourages and permits links to content on NPR Web sites. However, NPR is an organization committed to the highest journalistic ethics and standards and to independent, noncommercial journalism, both in fact and appearance. Therefore, the linking should not (a) suggest that NPR promotes or endorses any third party痴 causes, ideas, Web sites, products or services, or (b) use NPR content for inappropriate commercial purposes. We reserve the right to withdraw permission for any link.*

Anyway, as co-founder of Infoseek Japan (I'm still on the board), as a newbie blogger and as someone who believes that the contextual flexibility of the Internet is one of its most important attributes... I am horrified by the idea of limiting deep linking. It goes against the basic idea that brought us this medium in the first place.

A court in Copenhagen, Denmark ruled in favor of the Danish Newspaper Publisher's Association against the online news aggregator Newsbooster who was deep linking into the Newspaper's site. This is the first court ruling deep linking to be illegal.

I testified in a case in Japan where an Osaka court ruled that someone who linked to an illegal pornography site was actually running a pornography site and found guilty which has similar legal ramifications, but didn't seem to have the impact that the current deep linking debate has.

Sen proposes an interesting technical solution. (I always like technical solutions more than legal solutions.)  
> *Frankly, I think that if people don't want to allow deep linking, people should just configure their software (probably requires some implementation work and may be some access control depending on how strict the site wants to be) to not permit browsers to reach portions of their site directly w/o a "legal" referer.*

It's not a perfect solution, but I bet it would prevent 99% of people from reaching certain parts of websites directly...
