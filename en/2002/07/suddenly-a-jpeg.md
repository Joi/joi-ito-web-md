This ambush of the digitial imaging industry will probably stand as the worst public relations nightmare a company can inflict upon itself."

  
  
Thanks for sending this Sen. This is pretty intense. I wonder if this is the product of some vulture capitals, was planned from the beginning, some lawyers having fun, or something someone found when sifting through the assets of some acquisition. In any event, this should shake up the industry. Glad I don't manufacture digital cameras.
