[Yasunobe-san](http://www.yascreate.co.jp/), formerly of MITI said that the ATI-Stanford students were very motivated and interesting compared to many similar groups and that I should therefore accept the request from them to give a keynote at their upcoming conference. They then asked me to publicize it, so here you go. ;-)
  
  
I've been asked to talk about "Preparing for success as a global entrepreneur". I've been preparing for a long time, so I'm probably an expert on it. I wonder when I will eventually become successful. ;-)
  
  
To find out more about the program, take a look at [their web page](http://ati-tokyo.stanford.edu/conf/e_index.htm).
