Great article in the NYT about how a study shows that people's brains react positively when people cooperate. Using MRI scanning and the Prisoner's Dilemma, researchers were suprised by the results. This reinforces many of [Toshio Yamagishi's](http://lynx.let.hokudai.ac.jp/members/yamagishi/english.htm) ideas that [I wrote about in a previous entry](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/000127.html#000127).
> Hard as it may be to believe in these days of infectious greed and sabers unsheathed, scientists have discovered that the small, brave act of cooperating with another person, of choosing trust over cynicism, generosity over selfishness, makes the brain light up with quiet joy.
>
> Studying neural activity in young women who were playing a classic laboratory game called the Prisoner's Dilemma, in which participants can select from a number of greedy or cooperative strategies as they pursue financial gain, researchers found that when the women chose mutualism over "me-ism," the mental circuitry normally associated with reward-seeking behavior swelled to life.
> And the longer the women engaged in a cooperative strategy, the more strongly flowed the blood.
