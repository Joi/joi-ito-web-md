We had a costume party today. We had an Indian chef come and cook a wonderful curry feast. (Thanks for the intro Kumi!) We invited people from Neoteny and it's portfolio companies as well as people from Mizuka's dental clinic. It's amazing how many people cancelled at the last minute. My guess is that many of the people wimped out. ;-) It was a lot of fun though. We prepared power ranger sort of wear for those who didn't come with outfits. Luckily there were five people without outfits so we were able to get a power ranger group photo.

Utsumi, the CEO of Genec, came as his head on a platter. I wonder if that had a deeper meaning...
