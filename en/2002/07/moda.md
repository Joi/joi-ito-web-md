Dropped by Moda with Mizuka last night. Moda is a bar run by my Jr. high and high school classmate Tomo. We used to run the Nishimachi yearbook dark room together and also used to throw the school dance parties together. We're both still into photography, but Tomo has made a career out of throwing parties. ;-)
  
  
Tomo had redesigned the place and installed a dart board with an electronic scoring system. He also hired two guys and one of them cooks, so they serve food now. It's a cool place to hang out if you are in Harajuku. He has a [page with photos of his guests](http://www.photohighway.co.jp/AlbumPage.asp?key=316439&un=21689&m=2&s=0) as well as a web page about the [concept of Moda](http://home.catv.ne.jp/kk/moda/). I've been thinking about DJ'ing again for fun. Maybe Moda would be a good place to try it out...
