Saw Marc Canter for coffee and got his pitch on the future of things. I had been staring at "still Marc" for so long on his blog, that when I saw "full-motion Marc" it was totally amazing! Marc was a bundle of energy and excitement and totally inspiring. I have to remember that all of these people that I blog with and chat with have bodies that move, talk and gesture. ;-)

Later, Barak, Jun, Minami and I had dinner with John Markoff from the NYT and Paul Mercer who founded [Pixo](<br />
http://www.pixo.com/). It was a great dinner, but we talked about and played with our gadgets WAY too much. ;-)
