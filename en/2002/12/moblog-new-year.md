We're going to have an open moblog for people to post pictures to on New Year's Eve to welcome 2003. It is "open" but please use common sense when sending stuff. The URL is <http://www.bloggers.jp/>. The email address to send stuff to is [mailto:[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c5a8acb6aaaea485a7a9aaa2a2a0b7b6ebafb5). The site and the email address will be running between GMT 2002/12/31 0:00-23:59.

Send jpeg images as attachments with the title of the item as the subject. The template will resize the height to 120 pixels. 120x120 is probably the best size.

Pass it on. ;-)

*"Misoka" comes from "Omisoka" which means New Year's Eve in Japanese*
