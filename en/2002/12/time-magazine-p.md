[*saw this first on Dave Winer's weblog*](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/12/22#When:10:37:53AM)

[The whistleblowers at WorldCom, Enron and the FBI, Cynthia Cooper, Sherron Watkins and Colleen Rowley won the honor from Time Magazine this year.](http://www.time.com/time/personoftheyear/) This is great. They deserve it. They must be protected and honored.

You can't have whistleblowers without privacy and the [whistleblower protection bill that I am working on](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/11/05/protecting_whistleblowers.html) is also an important component. I've missed the last few meetings and I feel guilty. I see the bill headed towards bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo that won't help anyone. *Mental note to myself to make comments on the current draft which I don't agree with.* I wonder if the day will come when Japan honors whistleblowers like this. Time says, " They took huge professional and personal risks to blow the whistle on what went wrong at WorldCom, Enron and the FBI—and in so doing helped remind us what American courage and American values are all about." I hope that some day I can say this about Japanese values. Today, I don't think I can.
