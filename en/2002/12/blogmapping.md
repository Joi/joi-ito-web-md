My brother-in-law [Scott Fisher](http://web.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~sfisher/) is really into location based stuff and does a lot of stuff with augmented reality and virtual environments. He's at [USC now](http://www-cntv.usc.edu/people/chairbios.html), but is visiting for Christmas with my sister Mimi. Anyway, we were talking about blogs and location and he sent me the link for [Blogmapper](http://www.blogmapper.com/) which lets you associate blog entries with locations on a map. Scott interested in doing something in the area and so am I. Does anyone know of any other work going on in the area of tagging blog entries with location data? Obviously, location based moblogging is something we MUST do.
