Today I had dinner with Daiji Hirata, Tai Watanabe and [Kazuo Shimizu](http://www.drivingfuture.com/). Daiji, Kazuo and Neoteny are investors in Tai's company [MediaProbe](http://www.mediaprobe.co.jp/) which is working on an auto community site. Shimizu-san is probably the most famous auto journalist in Japan. He is invited by all of the big auto companies to test drive cars and write about all the cool new stuff. He's a BIG fan of the hydrogen economy and is the leading journalist in Japan on fuel cells. We talked about [ECD and their hydrogen technology.](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/11/23/the_hydrogen_economy.html) The US lead in a lot of the electric vehicle research as well as a lot of the early fuel cell work, but Japan is clearly putting a lot of effort behind the hydrogen economy and Toyota is probably leading the pack in hybrid cars. I hope that my next car will have a hydrogen component...
