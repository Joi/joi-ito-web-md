The Guardian [ran a piece on moblogs](http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/webwatch/story/0,12455,858719,00.html) and I got a link. Cool.

*Thanks for sending me this link [Howard](http://www.smartmobs.com/)*

We recently [moblogged a wedding](http://rsa.jp/) for Kana & Toshi. It's in Japanese, but you can get the idea. It was fun because a lot of people posted.

Planning to have a massive New Years Eve moblog. I will post the email address and instructions one we have the site ready...
