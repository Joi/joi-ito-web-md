Just sat down at Supernova. Supernova was organized by Kevin Werbach. This is the first one. The focus of the conference is decentralization. Topics include blogging, 802.11, network architectures, open source. It's a small conference with an amazing group of speakers and attendents.

The [group blog](http://192.246.69.113/) is online and a great example of trackbacks. I think this conference probably has the highest density of bloggers of any conference I've ever been to.
