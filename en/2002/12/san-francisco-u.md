I'm staying at Kara and Megan's house for three days (One more day left. Thanks Kara and Megan!) We had a few people over to the house the first night. Frank [blogged about it](http://www.boosman.com/blog/2002_12_01_blogarchive.html#90024584) much more promptly than I did. Met a bunch of new people. So many people, so little time. ;-) Thanks again to Kara for organizing and hosting.

Yesterday, I met Ryan Lackey who is the CTO of [Havenco](http://www.havenco.com/). I was one of the first investors in Havenco and had been working with Ryan for years and it was great to put a face behind the name. Also spent some quality time with Reid Hoffman, one of early PayPal execs who Frank introduced to me. We talked about PayPal, but also talked a little about his NEXT BIG THING which I am very excited about.

I also met Evan Williams and Jason Shellen of Blogger the day before yesterday. They were very cool. Unfortunately I took the restroom key with me by mistake. Sorry guys! (Not the best way to make friends...)

So I will be seeing David Winer and Mena and Ben Trott at [Supernova](http://www.pulver.com/supernova/) tomorrow. I feel like a Japanese pilgrim visiting all of the Blog/Weblog shrines in SF. ;-)

Well, I got 10 hours of sleep last night. The most I've gotten in months I think. I'm charged and ready for today which should involve going to see Brewster's Archive.org setup and his Bookmobile. If I have time, I'm planning on going out to see RU Sirius who is buried somewhere in Mill Valley I hear.
