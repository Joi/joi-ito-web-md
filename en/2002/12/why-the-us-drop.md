[Doc Searls writes about](http://doc.weblogs.com/2002/12/27#newsForEverybodyStuffThatReallyMatters) [an article](http://news.newspress.com/topsports/122702profhasegawa.htm?now=29973&tref=1) in the [Santa Barbara News-Press](http://news.newspress.com/) about UCSB history professor Tsuyoshi Hasegawa and his theory. The newspaper says:
> Santa Barbara News-Press
>
> The historical record holds that Japan surrendered in response to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States. Revisionists argue that the Japanese were already defeated at the time, and the atomic bombs were used simply to intimidate the Soviet Union.
>
> Mr. Hasegawa dismisses both views as "very, very American-centric."  
> ...  
> It was Josef Stalin's final-hour declaration of war on Japan that marked the end of the conflict in the Pacific, according to Mr. Hasegawa, whose specialties include Russian and Soviet history as well as Russo-Japanese relations.

Obviously, this is very relevant to the current "War-on-Terror" and is an important part of Japanese history. Japan is still struggling with Russia over the islands that the Russians claimed as theirs after the war...
