Slipped out of the conference to see Jean-Louis Gassée. I met Jean-Louis when he was running [Be Inc.](http://www.beincorporated.com/) I was the first and last advisory board member of Be. Jean-Louis is a legend in Silicon Valley from his days at Apple and all of the cool stuff he's done afterwards.

He is currently an Entrepreneur in Residence at [Allegis](http://www.allegiscapital.com/) and is on the board of [PalmSource](http://www.palmsource.com/) and [EFI](http://www.efi.com/). We talked a lot about personal networking technologies and shared our thoughts and vision in this area. He's such a cool and charming guy and I think Allegis is a PERFECT thing for him.

Barak and Minami joined me in the meeting and it was interesting because Barak had worked with him at Apple and Logitec so they had a lot of history... Frank got me back in touch with him. [Frank used to work with Jean-Louis at Be](http://www.boosman.com/blog/2002_12_01_blogarchive.html#90019889) and now works at and helps run one of our portfolio companies, [AirEight](http://www.aireight.com/).
