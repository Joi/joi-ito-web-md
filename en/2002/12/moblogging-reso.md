I'm starting to get bashed about not crediting for or getting too much credit for moblogging. A lot of stuff is out there and stuff is happening in parallel. I've tried to organize what I know about moblogging into an outline of stuff about moblogging and stuff about how to moblog. This is by no means complete. Can people please take a look and help me complete this resource list? I will keep it up to date.
