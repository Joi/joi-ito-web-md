| Shigeaki Saegusa and Yoshiko Morita |

[Saegusa-san](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/07/10/shigeaki_saegusas_kanreki.html) invited me to join a lunch at Yoshiko Morita's today. Mrs. Morita is the widow of Akio Morita, the co-founder of Sony. Saegusa-san is a family friend and was the composer of the requiem for Akio Morita memorial. She had seven of us over to her house for home-made *sake kasu* stew. *sake kasu* is a by-product of producing *sake*. Good *kasu* can only be obtained from a *sake* brewer. The Morita family business is brewing *sake*. Mrs. Morita explained that it was their main business and the whole electronics thing was a side business for them. ;-)

We talked a lot about cooking and I got a chance to brag about my [Turkey recipe](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/12/21/the_turkey.html). She said that she always has Christmas Turkey made at the Maxim's in the Sony building based on her recipe. I told her I would send her my recipe.

Mrs. Morita is a very dynamic and interesting person. She is involved heavily in the arts, and loves great food and interesting company. She is also a great social dancer. When I first met her, she was doing a the jitterbug at Saegusa-san's birthday party.

It was also fun visiting the house that described in such detail in John Nathan's [book about Sony](http://www.fsbassociates.com/hmco/sony.htm). We talked about John Nathan who she liked. John is the father of an old friend of mine, Zack. John is also a well-known translator of Japanese works such as the works of Mishima and Kenzaburo Oe.
