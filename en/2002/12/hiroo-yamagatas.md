Hiroo's notes are worth reading. It's a good summary and frames the issues in Japan well. Activism in Japan died with the student activists of the 70's. It's quite "un-cool" to be an activist. If Larry can get people like Hiroo to become activists and support important issues, I think we still have a chance.

> The [Future of Ideas](http://the-future-of-ideas.com) has been translated into [Japanese](http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4798102040/ref=lm_lb_1/250-8478338-4638610 ). As sometimes happens, the translation improves the book. Not only is the title better ("Commons", which the American publisher vetoed), but it also has a great and revealing [introduction](http://cruel.org/foi/foitrannotee.pdf) by the translator, Hiroo Yamagata. As always, the translator reveals as much about the work he translates as the world he translates into.
