OPML -  *Outline Processor Markup Language* Dave Winer's really into this. So am I. (after I figured out what it was...) I've always wanted to figure this out, but I could never get my head around Radio Userland enough to get it to do what I wanted with my outlines. [Marc Canter has also been raving about Outlines](http://blogs.it/0100198/2002/10/10.html). So today, I finally got around to R'ingTFM and found [activeRenderer](http://radio.weblogs.com/0104487/outlines/aR/activeRenderer.html) by Marc Barrot which renders your OPML files into cool collapsable outlines in Radio Userland. Actually, OmniOutline (Which Chris Adams turned me on to in [my entry about my switch to Mac](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/12/01/see_ya_later_windoze.html)) allows me to save in OPML so I can render these as well. (Although I can't figure out how to add links in OmniOutline so they show up as links when rendered.)

So, I've got [Radio Userland running](http://radio.weblogs.com/0114939/) now and [here is my first outline](http://radio.weblogs.com/0114939/outlines/web.html), which will hopefully evolve to my "view" of the web.

I've very excited by everything except the fact that Radio 8.0.8 "quits unexpectedly" at random times on OS X 10.2.2. [The new 8.0.9b1 fixes this problem. Thanks Dave and Jake!]
