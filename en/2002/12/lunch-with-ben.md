| Ben and Mena Trott |

Had lunch with Ben and Mena Trott, the founders and developers of [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) who were here for the Supernova conference. I'm a great fan of theirs because Movable Type was my introduction to blogging and I am very happy that I chose Movable Type as my blog software. (Thanks to [Justin](http://www.links.net/) for making this decision for me.) [Hirata](http://uva.jp/dh/mt/) in my office worked on the Japanese language kit for MT and we talked about some of the issues involved in localization and about the blogging landscape in Japan...
