So it looks like my web site is finally ready for a soft launch. Now I have to figure out what to do with the Japanese version... Anyway, thanks [Justin](http://www.links.net/), for helping me get this far. I think this blog format is much better than my old static page which I had edit html directly. For anyone who isn't using blog software to do their web page, I highly recommend it. If you don't know what a blog is, google for it. ;-)

Any comments about the site would be really helpful.
