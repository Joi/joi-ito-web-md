We have formed a Japan chapter of [Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility](http://www.cpsr.org/). [Shinji Yamane](http://www.vacia.is.tohoku.ac.jp/~s-yamane/), who has been working on this project for quite a while will be the chair. [Kazuo Fujimoto](http://vs.valdes.titech.ac.jp/~fujimoto/sakushin-u/) will be the secretary and I will be the treasurer initially. I am trying to get CPSR to help me show the technical problems with the National ID program that Japan is trying to implement. [We have a local movement protesting the national ID.](http://kokuminbango.hantai.jp/)
