There is something special about good old American Lasagne done well. I personally
like it better than traditional Italian Lasagne. Recently, I've been using a
ragu sauce taken from the [Harry's
Bar Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553070304/qid=918966394/sr=1-2/002-6128853-1404235) (thanks to Christine Schoepf of Ars Electronica for recommending
this great book to me!) with a more traditional American Lasagne recipe. The
ragu may be a little to... "fancy" tasting for the lasagne, but I'm
not sure. I'm going to try to modify the sause a bit in the future... But below
is my "current recipe" for my favorite lasagne. (If you like the Ragu,
by the book. The link above is to Amazon.com's entry for the book.)

## The Ragu

- 1 carrot, peeled
- 1 celery rib
- 1 small onion
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1 garlic clove, crushed
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1/2 cup tomato paste
- 2 table spoons flour
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 1 quart veal stock
- 1 teaspoon salt
- fresh ground peper
- bouquet garni (1 fresh rosemary sprig, 1 fresh thyme sprig, 2 flat-leaf
  parsley sprigs tied in cheesecloth

Chop carrot, celery and onion. Use 1/2 of the oil and saute the vegetables
over medium heat for 10 minutes. In another pan, heat remaining oil, add garlic,
cook for about 30 seconds and discard garlic. Add the beef. Cook the meet until
brown (approx 10 min.). Combine everything and add the tomato paste. Cook for
2 minutes. Add flour and cool another 2 minutes. Raise the heat, add wine, evaporate
wine, add stock, salt, pepper, bouquet garni. Bring to boil, reduce heat, add
and simmer for 1 hour stirring from time to time.

This sauce makes a very good spagetti sauce too.
