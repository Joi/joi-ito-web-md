I'm really getting into [Photo.net](http://www.photo.net/). I had been using it mostly for the discussion forums, but recently I created a profile and set up a [portfolio](http://www.photo.net/photodb/user?user_id=576813). It tracks all of my equipment all the way down to the serial numbers. I scanned a bunch of my 6x6's into Pro Photo CD's and uploaded them to the site. [I even got positive feedback on one of my photos!](http://www.photo.net/photodb/photo?photo_id=1102176) [Photo.net](http://www.photo.net/) which I think was started by Philip Greenspun is obviously a site built by geeks for true enthusiasts and is a real pleasure to use after trying all of the "commercial" photo sites. I think I've found my online home for my photography.
