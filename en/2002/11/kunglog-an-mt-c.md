Our guys just upgraded our server to MT 2.5 and I just installed [Kung-Log](http://www.kung-foo.tv/kunglog.php) on my [Mac](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/11/08/trying_the_switch.html). It's nice with all kinds of pull down menus and stuff. It makes up for the fact that one click URL'ing doesn't work in MT on the Mac.
