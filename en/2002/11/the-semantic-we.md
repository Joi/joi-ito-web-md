There is an interesting discussion going on various blogs about "The Semantic Web". [Russel Beattie](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/index.jsp?date=20021101#165113) starts a discussion about it. Les Orchard makes [a nice attempt at explaining it on his blog](http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000315.phtml). According to Les, [Tim Berners-Lee talked about it on NPR Science.](http://www.sciencefriday.com/pages/2002/Nov/hour2_110102.html) I thought about it a lot when I was running Infoseek Japan and I was thinking about how [XML would impact](http://joi.ito.com/archives/1998/12/15/study_group_on_xml_with_jiro_kokuryo.html) search engines. Thinking about how metadata and schema for metadata will evolve is a very interesting topic. It is as much political and social as it is technical. When you run a search engine, there is a constant trade-off between brute-forcing information indexes and waiting for the metadata. If the sematic web really existed and you could run the queries in a distributed way, you wouldn't REALLY need search engines, at least in the way they are designed now. What's so exciting about blogs and things like [RSS](http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/) is that the community is pushing the metadatification of the sematic web in a way that no standards body or company could ever have done.
