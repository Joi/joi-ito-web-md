Saw a cool trick on [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/2002_11_01_archive.html#85663103). If you search for "http" on Google, the results are sites ranked by page ranking. As Boing Boing notes, the tops sites are search site. Asahi.com, the online news paper is number one and that most of the top Japanese sites are mass media sites. I love that *tabi no madoguchi* makes it into the Top 10 in Japan. It's a great site and is all about *conversation on the living web* come true.
