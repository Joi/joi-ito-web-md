> Microsoft to reveal source code to Japan, which has eyed Linux](http://www.japantimes.com/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20021128a2.htm "The Japan Times Online")

> Microsoft Corp. will disclose the source code of the Windows operating system to the Japanese government in line with the government's e-Japan project, company officials said Wednesday.

I recently [made a public comment on the record](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/11/08/national_id_and_privacy_issues_continue.html) at the oversight committee for the National ID about Microsoft and trying to get them to open up the source code. I wonder if this had any effect. I guess we must all have had an effect. I assume many people have been saying this. It's a great step forward, even if it is just MS trying to keep Linux out.
