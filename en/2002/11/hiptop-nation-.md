![2hiptops.jpg](http://joi.ito.com/jp/archive/images/2hiptops.jpg)[Hiptop Nation](http://hiptop.bedope.com/) is a blog for[Danger's](http://www.danger.com/) Hiptop owners. They recently had a Halloween Scavenger Hunt. [Smartmobs blogs about it](http://www.smartmobs.com/archives/000333.html) and one of the members of one of the teams has [written a paper](http://hiptop.bedope.com/hunt/raven/index.php?FILTER=pbhagmreb@cbegnybsrivy.pbz&GIMME_ENTRY=402Smart) about it.

Teams, games, wireless devices, photos. Cool stuff for blogs moving forward.

Speaking of games, although this is a bit old, I thought [Survivor Blog](http://www.littleyellowdifferent.com/survivor2/) was very cool.

We have a lot of different wireless devices in Japan that let you take pictures and email them. We should try to think of some cool games too.
