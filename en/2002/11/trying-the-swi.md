[![switching_thumb.jpg](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/switching_thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/switching.html)  
Just installed OS X 10.2 and am trying to ["Make the Switch"](http://www.apple.com/switch/)... I'm using Mizuka's old Powerbook G4 with the broken "/" key, not [the cool new one](http://www.apple.com/powerbook/) that just came out. I just ordered office and all of the Adobe stuff, so until that arrives, I can't completely switch. I feel totally screwed up right now though. I have a [Sony Vaio C1MRX](http://www.dynamism.com/c1mrx/index.shtml) with a great form factor and excellent battery life, I have a Dell Latitude coming that I'm going to configure with with Windows 2000 in a very security conscious mode ([after talking to Chris Goggan](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/10/29/drinks_with_chris_goggans_aka_erik_bloodaxe.html) about what the most secure PC setup was...) and now I have this PowerBook. I hope I am only using one of these a month from now and I HOPE it is going to be the PowerBook.
