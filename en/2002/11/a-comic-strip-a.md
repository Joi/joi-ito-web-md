We've been debating in Japanese about what a blog is and whether it is any different from diary sites or other web pages. I've had quite a difficult time defending the position that blogs are really anything special. [Here is a funny comic strip of a discussion between a grumpy girl and a questioning ant](http://invisibleshoebox.blogspot.com/2002_11_10_invisibleshoebox_archive.html#84381693) on that topic.

Seen first on [for the sake of clarity](http://radio.weblogs.com/0108247/2002/11/12.html#a95).
