I got my P504iS today. It is the new i-mode phone with a built-in camera. They went on sale last week. [Docomo's i-mode council](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/06/28/imode_council.html) upgrades our phones for us so we can play with the new features. (No wonder people are mad at me. ;-p ) Anyway, the one I got, the Panasonic phone has two cameras! One points at you and one away. There are also two color LCD displays. This is the perfect mobile photo blogging device. Now I have two cameras in my phone, a voice recorder in my digital camera, a camera in my computer and a camera in my Clie Palm. Do I need all of these cameras? Of course...
