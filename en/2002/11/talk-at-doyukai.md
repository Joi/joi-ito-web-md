I gave a talk today at the [*Keizai Doyukai*](http://www.doyukai.or.jp/) (Association of Corporate Executives) Secretariat study group meeting. I talked about Neoteny, venture capital and... blogs. ;-p Many of the older guys fell asleep. At the lunch, I sat next to Yotaro "Tony" Kobayashi. I'm a big fan of Tony's. He's very smart, nice, well-dressed and important. He is the chairman of the *Keizai Doyukai* and Fuji-Xerox. Tony also represents the *Keizai Doyukai* to the World Economic Forum so I gave him an update on the [Blueprint for Japan 2020](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/08/29/blueprint_for_japan_2020.html). I told him that we were [discussing the issue of women's participation in my blog](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/10/30/wef_blueprint_for_japan_2020_at_the_orchid_room.html) and suggested that his wife, Momo, who I respect greatly and who is very smart and outspoken, should join the meeting and help us understand the women's perspective. He said he thought that was a good idea. He said she often asks questions that many men are either afraid to ask or have forgotten how to ask...

I was complaining to him about the [whole NBC thing](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/10/24/nbc_press_conference.html) and mentioned I wanted to quit. Watanabe-san who is working on a collaborative project between the *Keizai Doyukai* and NBC heard me and asked if I was going to quit. Oooops! Cat-out-of-the-bag, foot-in-the-mouth... I said I would serve until I completed my duties at the chair of the forum, but that I was planning on leaving after that. I said I blogged it already...
