Thanks to [Gen Kanai](http://kanai.net/weblog/) for introducing me to [David Isenberg](http://www.isen.com/). David is famous for many things including his paper ["The Rise of the Stupid Network"](http://www.isen.com/stupid.html)  David was [talking a lot about Oil](http://www.isen.com/archives/020116.html). He says that "Hubbert's Peak", when oil production will begin to drop, will happen in 2003. On the other hand, world energy consumption will increase 66% (USA Today, 1/10/02) from 1999-2020. It's OBVIOUSLY time for the Hydrogen Economy that we're starting to get very excited about.

David was extremely bright and gave me an interesting view into the "prosultants" (vs "consultants") who are smart researchers who trying to figure things out and convey them to people and companies. I guess that's what I try to do in my own small way. He invited me to several interesting conference and I hope to see him more often more now that we are linked.

*I was so excited while talking to him that I forgot to take a picture. I had to steal the picture from his web page.*
