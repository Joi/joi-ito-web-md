[Ruseel Beattie's excited that I blogged his blog.](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/index.jsp?date=20021104#011857) So I blog him again since I'm excited that he blogged me. I found a bad link on [John Patrick's Blog](http://patrickweb.com/weblog/2002/11/03.html#a121) so he was nice enough to put a link back to me. (This entry is a perfect excuse to return the favor. ;-) ) And as the links go round-and-round, and our google rankings go up-and-up, it feels great, but are we really getting anywhere? Well, the [discussion about the Semantic Web](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/11/04/the_semantic_web.html) is important and slightly relevant to what I do for a living.

Dave Winer quotes Russell in the context of procrastination which blogging can quickly become. Since Dave Winer is a "blog professional", I guess he should be allowed to blog all he wants.

> [I enjoy reading](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/index.jsp?date=20021104#001325) Russell Beattie's weblog, esp today as he writes about a book that teaches you how to get things done. It seems Russ is procrastinating on a grand project, by reading a book on how not to procrastinate. He has a wonderful quote from Will Rogers. "When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging." Interesting. I do the opposite.
