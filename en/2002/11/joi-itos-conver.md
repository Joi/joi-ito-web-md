What do you think of the slogan, "Joi Ito's conversation with the living web"? I got the conversation part from [The Cluetrain Manifesto](http://www.cluetrain.com/) and the living web part from [10 Tips to Writing the Living Web](http://www.alistapart.com/stories/writeliving/). People kept asking me what the difference was between a blog and a web site. I said it was different because I wasn't publishing, I was having a conversation. I didn't have "readers" I was part of a "living web". I have no idea if that gets the message across, but I sure like the sound of it.
