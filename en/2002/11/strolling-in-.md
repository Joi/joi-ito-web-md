Decided to take a stroll in the park with Mizuka instead of blogging a day. It was a beautiful day. I've uploaded some pictures I took with my Sony Cybershot DSC-P5. I wish I had a better photo album online. Does anyone know of a good photo album server I can run on a Apple XServe?

[yakiimo_thumb.jpg](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/yakiimo.html) *Yakiimo* is the great portable food of the fall/winter in Japan. These little trucks roast the sweet potatoes in ovens billowing smoke with this great tape recorded message going on and on about how nice, sweet and hot the potatoes are.  [corn_thumb.jpg](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/corn.html) Another great outdoor food is grilled corn. The corn has soy sauce on it that burns and smells like... burnt soy sauce. All Japanese are conditioned to salivate when they smell burnt soy sauce.  [fleamarket_thumb.jpg](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/fleamarket.html) The Japanese made a mistake and Japlish took over on this one. "free market" and "flea market" are generally used interchangeably. Some web sites talk about "free markets" being more "open" "flea markets"... So here is a "free market"...  [flearight_thumb.jpg](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/flearight.html) The local right wing truck showed up to join the festivities with speakers blaring on about the Japan flea market economy...  [komabike_thumb.jpg](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/komabike.html) Komazawa Park has these great bikes for 2 people that you can cruise around in. Mizuka wanted to ride one, but we got turned down and told that they were for kids. |
