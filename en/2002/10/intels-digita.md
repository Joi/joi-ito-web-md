> A key component of the Extended Wireless PC Initiative's media distribution architecture is a new PC peripheral called the digital media adapter, which provides an appliance-like link between PCs, TVs, and stereos. The device, which is based on an XScale microarchitecture PCA210 'applications processor' and runs an embedded Linux operating system, receives digital media from the PC via 802.11 wireless networking and UpnP technologies, and connects to TVs and stereos using standard audio/video cables -- much like a DVD player. Using a simple remote control, consumers navigate through menus on a TV screen, selecting the PC digital media they wish to receive.

> The 'magic sauce' is something called [UpnP](http://developer.intel.com/labs/connectivity/upnp/) (universal plug and play) which was originally designed for plugging cards into a PC bus or USB devices (such as keyboards or mice.) But now they have a 'stack' to route A/V info to the Digital Media Adapter. I wonder is UPnP can sense out I.P. addresses like [Apple's Rendezvous](http://www.apple.com/macosx/jaguar/rendezvous.html) (otherwise known as [ZeroConf](http://www.zeroconf.org/)) and make setting up Home LANs easy to do?

![vis_site02.jpg](http://joi.ito.com/jp/archive/images/vis_site02.jpg)This reminds me of my [SliMP3 that I wrote about earlier](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/07/14/slimp3_ethernet_mp3_player.html), but that doesn't have wireless or video. It also reminds me of my [Sony Airboard](http://www.sony.jp/airboard/indexpc.html) which has 802.11, ethernet, dialup Internet, TV and a browser. The Airboard is less of a "hub" and more of an "all-in-one". I guess the key to the Intel thing will be low cost and open standards. If they can help orchestrate a bunch of devices without trying to make their device do everything, it might work. I still don't like the idea of "fat" home servers. I am hoping that, at least in my house, I can use everything I already have. My PC hard disk, my audio amp and speakers, my plasma display and my digital satellite dish... Having said that, there may be a market for small all-in-one's...
