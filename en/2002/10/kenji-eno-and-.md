| [enomoriguchi_thumb.jpg](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/enomoriguchi.html) Eno-san and Moriguchi-san meet for the first time... |

Today, I went to see Eno-san and talk about blogs and other things. My good friend [Hiroko Moriguchi](http://www.mogeshan.net/) was there working on a project (secret for now...) with Eno-san. It was the first time they had met. I love it when two people I really like meet for the first time. ;-)

Hiroko Moriguchi is very smart and very funny. It will be interesting to see what happens when we mix her taste with Eno-san who is weird, funny and smart in his own way as well. I look forward to seeing how their project goes.

Eno-san promised to help me recruit bloggers and to work on his own blog. I think we should get Hiroko to do a blog too. I didn't get a chance to talk to her about this, but next time I see her I will...
