[![pwn_logo.gif](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/pwn_logo.gif)](http://www.silentnolonger.com/)Daniel Lubetzky of [Peaceworks](http://www.silentnolonger.com/) joined our session at the GLT summit, "[Rebuilding Modern Politics: Can the System Fix Itself?](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/09/23/rebuilding_modern_politics_can_the_system_fix_itself.html)" and talked about his project. Peaceworks is an amazing group working on empowering people and the "moderate" voices in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. They use Internet, newspapers, telephones and a variety of technologies to get the voice of the people, which is much more moderate than the extremists who currently control poltics. I think the strategy of Peaceworks of using technology to short circuit the legistlature which is so heavily influenced by extremists is a great idea that may even be relevant in the US. You you can't change politics directly, go around them. After you get the "moderate voice" aired, it becomes easier to for the moderate politicians to take a moderate stance. A stance that they can't take when the voices of the exteremists are the only ones that are heard.

[Take a look at the overview](http://www.silentnolonger.com/wwd_overview.html). There is a good [flash presentation](http://www.silentnolonger.com/presentation/) as well.
