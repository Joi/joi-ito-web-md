Under the ENUM system being analysed by the Australian Communications Authority, one number could track down a person via a home or mobile phone number, or an email or website address.  
This is SOOO bad. Where is my favorite Australian privacy expert [Roger Clarke](http://www.anu.edu.au/people/Roger.Clarke/)?

In Japan the [Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications](http://www.soumu.go.jp/english/index.html) (who brought us the National ID system I've been protesting) also controls all of the phone numbers. This is yet another stupid idea that links identity to some sort of government number. Why can't we all have a variety of screen name/email addresses and dump phone numbers all together. Why don't we just phone email addresses? This whole idea is backwards...

I can understand the desire to trace everything to a physical body, but don't they understand that it means that ANYONE with a PC and a brain will be able to trace stuff back to us? The risks, I believe, outweigh the benefits.
