I just got my photo CD of the pictures I took on Menorca with my Hasselblad. This is the first time I had my 6X6's scanned. They turned out nice. I posted them on [imagestation](http://www.imagestation.com/album/?id=4291302221) and [Yahoo Photos](http://photos.yahoo.com/jito23/lst?&.dir=/Menorca+Hasselblad). The pictures are nice though so please take a look if you have time. I'll add captions when I get back from China I think.
