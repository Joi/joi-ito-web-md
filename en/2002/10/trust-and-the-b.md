[I just posted the following in Doc Searls Weblog.](http://doc.weblogs.com/discuss/msgReader$2603?mode=day)

> I was talking to Veer of Blogstreet the other day in the context of blog rolls. I think it is about developing networks of trust. If disclaimers and disclosures help your readers trust you. Great. Do it. It is all part of building trust. If people understand what type of person you are and what your ehtics are through reading your blog, I think there is great value. If someone is doing it for fun and is VERY personal, I think that disclosures are less important. If you write in a very objective style, you may need to disclose more to earn the kind of trust you are looking for. I don't formally disclose much in my blog about my conflicts, but I write about almost everything I do in sort of a diary form and even blog about the conflicts I have as part of my content.

> I think that the way blogs create and manage trust between bloggers and between bloggers are readers is more dynamic than the way formal journalism does it. I think you just need to find a style that adds the most value to yourself and the people you talk to and stick to it. I need to think about this more, but "trust" is a very key word. Blogs enable the creation and management of trust outside of centralized brands and authority...

It is part of an interesting discussion going on right now about Blogging Ethics.
