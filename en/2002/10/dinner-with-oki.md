Oki striking a pose...

Had dinner last night with Oki Matsumoto, Yu Serizawa and Yasukuni Ichikawa and his brother Takayoshi Ichikawa... We ate at Kanayuni, one of my favorite restaurants that I've been going to since I was about 13 years old...

It was kind of a wrap-up and what do we do next meeting after the [Blueprint 2020](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/09/23/glt_summit_expo_bazaar_booth_blueprint_for_tomorrows_japan.html) presentation Oki and I did in Geneva. Yu works for the [World Economic Forum](http://www.weforum.org/) and is organizing this whole thing. Yasukuni Ichikawa did a lot of research for the [presentation](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/presentations/Blueprint2020gltsummit.ppt) and prepared it for us. His brother was tagging along. ;-)

Oki Matsumoto is the CEO of [Monex](http://www.monex.co.jp/visitor/monex/investors/index.html), an online brokerage firm. He and I were the only Japanese "Global Leaders for Tomorrow" who went to the [Geneva Summit](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/09/23/global_leaders_for_tomorrow_summit_2002.html). I asked Oki what he thought about the market. He didn't think it would go down to 6000. I think we all agreed that Japan was a bit different than Argentina in that it has been able to keep people and it's GDP from fleeing. (So far.) The biggest short term problem was the balance sheet and Oki thought that with the right reforms we could fix that. The "flow" problem was a long term problem and the "stock" problem was a short term problem. I'll leave the "stock" problem up to the bankers and the economists. I'm very worried about the long term "flow" problem. Ageing, competition in manufacturing, political, military, education, media, etc.
