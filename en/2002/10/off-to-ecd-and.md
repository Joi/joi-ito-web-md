I'm off to Michigan to visit [ECD](http://www.ovonic.com/). I haven't been in Michigan since I was still on the board of ECD. I'm excited to see all of the new science and technology that must have happened since I was there last. A tour of ECD is like nothing else on earth. It's really like a trip through the future. I'll also be seeing a lot of old friends as well as my father who still works at ECD... If I can get my connection working, I'll blog stuff about it from Michigan.

Originally, it was just a trip to ECD and back, but I got the following email yesterday:[![POP2_header_2002_circle.gif](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/POP2_header_2002_circle.gif)](http://www.poptech.com/)

Are you in the US Oct 18-20? I'm going to PopTech then --- [www.poptech.com](http://www.poptech.com/) --- I got an extra ticket for my sister, but she can't come... so I was trying to sell it. It's an excellent conference up in Camden, Maine (leaves changing colors)...

hosted by John Sculley, Bob Metcalfe and others -- great themes each year and a great group. This year it's Artificial Worlds -- about communities and games and VR, etc etc etc. Lots of people you know are going. Any chance you'd be interested? Conference is mainly Friday, Saturday and Sunday am -- with an reception on Thursday night.

Howard Rheingold, Dan Gillmor, Linda Stone, Simson Garfinkel, Jaron Lanier, Amy Bruckman... Lots of people I know, plus John Sculley, Bob Metcalfe, Alexander Shulgin, Vernor Vinge, Stephen Wolfram... Lots of people I don't know. Camden, Maine... OK I'm there. Unfortunately, I can only go for one day...
