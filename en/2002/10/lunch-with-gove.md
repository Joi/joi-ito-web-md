Went to Chiba and had lunch with Governor Domoto of Chiba with whom I've become quite friendly lately. Chiba is the prefecture where William Gibson's Neuromancer starts out. Narita International Airport and Disneyland are also in Chiba. It is kind of a long train ride out, but I was able to pass the time having an IM chat with [John Patrick](http://patrickweb.com/) on my [i-mode AIM client that Neeraj made](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/10/11/neerajs_aim_for_imode.html).

Domoto-san was her usual energetic self. I talked about some ideas I had for projects in Narita and Makuhari. I talked to her about [ECD and renewable energy](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/10/18/ecd_informationenergy.html). Domoto-san is an environmentalist and she got very excited about the idea of the Hydrogen Economy. I also talked about blogs. Domoto-san was an independant who [won with a rather grassroots election](http://www.asahi.com/column/hayano/eng/010402.html) effort that leveraged the Net. She liked the idea of blogs and promised to try it out. I promised to dispatch someone from the [Neoteny Blogging Team](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/10/09/the_neoteny_blogging_team.html) to help her out.

I often talk to her about how Mizuka and I only eat organic vegetables now. She gave me an organic *daikon* (Japanese Radish). It was a bit strange carrying it in the crowded train back to Tokyo... I'm looking forward to eating it. ;-)
