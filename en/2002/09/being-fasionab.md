[*The picture is from the shoene (Cool Suit) Page.*](http://www.sutv.zaq.ne.jp/ckafw600/yofuku/coolsuit.htm)[![hadasemisleev.jpg](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/hadasemisleev.jpg)](http://www.sutv.zaq.ne.jp/ckafw600/yofuku/coolsuit.htm)Yesterday was probably one of the hottest most uncomfortable days I've ever had from a fashion perspective. We were all wearing suits and ties from 9am to 8pm sitting in the same room of a Japanese government building with the themostat set at the official 28 degrees (which is 82 degrees fahrenheit) for government buildings. This energy saving policy is a good thing from a tax paper perspective, but pretty tough for someone like me who isn't used to it. This policy prompted a whole line of energy saving suits. Former Prime Minister Hata is show here on the "cool suit" page with his short sleeve *shoene suit* which I hear he still wears.

Also, the New York Times reports: [The Nation: Pressed for Success; When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Put On Suits](http://query.nytimes.com/search/abstract?res=F50C15F93E590C7B8DDDA10894DA404482)

At the meeting yesterday, I complained about the heat as well as the fact that we all were wearing neckties. One of the older men said, "I can't focus without my necktie on." Another guy said, "it doesn't feel like you're working when you don't have a tie on."

Well. TOUGH. I'm wearing shorts and a short sleeve shirt today. I'm not tucking my shirt in either. So for those of you people who are offended by my fashion today, too bad!
