So I'm in my hotel room using an analog dialup connection to an Austrian Earthlink POP that is flakey. I've got a Sony-Ericsson phone that isn't doing gprs properly and I've got a Siemens phone that whose gprs is working, but I don't have the right cable. My VPN client isn't working so I can't read my email... I have connectivity blues... I've taken a lot of pictures and have a lot of blog material, but with the tiny screen on my Sony C1MRX and this tiny pipe... blogging is a totally different experience. Anyway, these are all excuses for why I haven't written much the last few days. Anyway, it's been hectic. So IF I can get gprs working in Menorca, I should have a whole week of relaxing island peace where I can blog to my heart's content and catch up a bit. If I don't, I'll be on the beach trying to forget about my blog... Eve is supposed to be arranging a gprs phone that works in Menorca, so I'm crossing my fingers.

Sorry for this boring blog entry. It is my obligatory, "I'm still alive" entry.
