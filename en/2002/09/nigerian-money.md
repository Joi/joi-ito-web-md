*I found a new form of parody of [419 Fraud](http://home.rica.net/alphae/419coal/) letters ("Nigerian Money Laundry Scam") on [BoingBoing](http://boingboing.net/2002_09_01_archive.html#85486499). Here are excerpts from two. (Click the links to see the entire documents.) The [first one](http://atrios.blogspot.com/2002_08_18_atrios_archive.html#80547516) is Dick Cheney and the [second one](http://brainslug.org/archives/000224.html#000224) is Mrs. GW Bush.*

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Mr Dick Cheney a special adviser on Petroleum and economic matters to the Head of State of The United States of America. Because of my strategic position in the former Government, and also being a close confidant of the Head of State, I was able to acquire personally, the Sum of $25,000,000,000.00USD (twenty-five billion United States Dollars) presently lodged in some offshore sham bank owned by his brother Neil.

ATTN: President/CEO

I am the widow of the late President George W. Bush of the United States of America. I am writing you this letter in confidence regarding my current circumstances.

I escaped the United States ahead of death squads with my husband and two children Jenna and Frank, moving first to England and then, when my husband's political enemies took power there, to Austria. All of our wealth, obtained legitimately through baseball, oil drilling and insider trading, was seized by the new government of the USA under the despotic regime of (Dr.) Noam Chomsky, except for the contents of a few Swiss bank accounts. These bank accounts, which contain social security lock-box funds and the bulk of the 2001 budget surplus, could not be accessed by me or my children, due to agreements made between the socialist government of the USA and Swiss bank regulators. They seized our ranch in Crawford, Texas and now use it to teach homosexualist propaganda to schoolchildren.
