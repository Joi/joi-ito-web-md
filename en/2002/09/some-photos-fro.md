In wonder if this is the best photo site. Branding works. The first place I went to look for a photo album online was photos.yahoo.com and there it was. Right now I am using an OSX server and we can't seem to get perl module installed to let me do thumbnails in Movable Type. Also, doing titles and captions was a pain so I wanted to try an album site. On the other hand the photo titles and the layout in Yahoo Photos seems to suck as well. Maybe I haven't figure it out properly... Anyway, here are the photos:
