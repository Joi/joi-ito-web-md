[In an interview on Slashdot](http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/09/06/1343222&mode=thread&tid=145), Larry Wall, the legendary inventor of Perl is interviewed and asked about God.

A) God exists, and  
B) God is good to people who really look for him.

That's it. The "good news" is so simple that a child can understand it, and so deep that a philosopher can't.

Now, it appears that you're willing to admit the possibility of bit A being a 1, so you're almost halfway there. Or maybe you're a quarter way there on average, if it's a qubit that's still flopping around like Shoedinger's Cat. You're the observer there, not me--unless of course you're dead. :-)

A lot of folks get hung up at point B for various reasons, some logical and some moral, but mostly because of Shroedinger again. People are almost afraid to observe the B qubit because they don't want the wave function to collapse either to a 0 or a 1, since both choices are deemed unpalatable. A lot of people who claim to be agnostics don't take the position so much because they don't know, but because they don't want to know, sometimes desperately so.

Because if it turns out to be a 0, then we really are the slaves of our selfish genes, and there's no basis for morality other than various forms of tribalism.

And because if it turns out to be a 1, then you have swallow a whole bunch of flim-flam that goes with it. Or do you?   
See that's the problem with the "one God" and the "me and God" religions. They are way too complicated.

Buddhists... If Mind -> 0 Then You -> 1  
Much easier.   
Think of your spirit as the wave and your body as the particle. Then Spirit = Body\*C^2 (I guess that would mean that fat people have more spirit... hmm...)

It all gets a bit more complicated when you start dancing around doing energy conversion like Tai Chi. See the [Dancing Wu Li Masters](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/055326382X/qid=1031609363/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-1859841-3048127?v=glance&s=books) which talks about Tai Chi and quantum physics.
