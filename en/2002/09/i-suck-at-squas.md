I suck at squash, but I still like to play. I played squash with Yuichi and Shane this morning from 6:30am. It took me only 13 minutes where it usually sometimes takes up to an hour. Just driving to the gym is worth getting up early for. I really suck at squash, but I beat Shane 2 out of 3 today. I only sometimes beat Shane, but this is the first time I won more matches than him. I've never beat Yuichi who is really good.
