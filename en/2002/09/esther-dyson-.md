Cool! I was officially recognized as a "Japanese digital entrepreneur/venture capitalist" by Esther Dyson! Saw this article today for the first time. (Thanks [Frank](http://www.boosman.com/blog/)!) This about the [Fortune Brainstorming Conference I blogged about](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/07/29/on_my_way_to_fortunes_brainstorm_2002_in_aspen.html). I brought everyone the [MELCO Airstation](http://buffalo.melcoinc.co.jp/products/catalog/item/w/wla-s11gk/index.html). It is the smallest 802.11b access point that I know of. Recently, all port-a-demo pitches in Japan of network technologies involve one of these little guys.
