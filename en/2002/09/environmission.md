> EnviroMission owns the exclusive licence to German designed Solar Tower technology in Australia. Our first project will focus on developing this revolutionary technology into the world’s first large-scale solar thermal power station capable of generating enough electricity to supply 200,000 typical Australian homes.

The technology involves a huge solar heater with a tower that takes the hot air and pulls it up through the tower and spins turbines. This SO sci-fi sexy and SO Australia... The tower will be the, "largest engineered structure ever proposed for construction."

[There is a flash animation of how the technology works.](http://www.enviromission.com.au/project/technology.htm) [The company is already trading on the Australian stock exchange.](http://www.asx.com.au/asx/markets/PriceResults.jsp?method=post&template=F1001&ASXCodes=evm) [They have built a prototype.](http://www.enviromission.com.au/project/prototype.htm)
