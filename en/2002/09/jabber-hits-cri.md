*I first saw this on [Marc Canter's page](http://blogs.it/0100198/), but he got it from [Doc Searls Weblog](http://doc.weblogs.com/) who got it from Wesley Felter on [Hack the Planet 2.0](http://wmf.editthispage.com/2002/08/30) who saw it on [cnet](http://news.com.com/2100-1023-956097.html).*

> News.com: Out with AOL, in with Jabber. It had to happen eventually. Now it has. The non-interoperative closed doors on IM systems from AOL, MSN and Yahoo are now fated to open. The sooner those companies realize this is a Good Thing that their customers have always wanted, they better off they'll be. Apple shoud take the lead in opening up IM, as it has with so many other standards (USB, SCSI, FireWire, wi-fi and now [Rendezvous](http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/0208/29.rendezvous.php)).   
> The company's new [iChat](http://www.apple.com/macosx/jaguar/ichat.html) already makes some use of the Jabber IM protocol. I suspect the only reason iChat is closed (except to AIM) is due to some contractual agreement with AOL. But that also puts Apple in a unique position to tell AOL the gig is up.

> DUUUUUUUUDE! Apple's new iChat IS AIM. It's licensed technology. That's the only way Apple can link into the AIM universe. That's what AOL announced is their inter-op strategy -let others license THEIR engine. So - no - I don't think you'll see little Stevie taking any leadership steps here.........

> And BTW - it should be noted that the ONLY way to get Renezvous to work is to open it up. It wouldn't do much - if all it did was configure Apple products - right? Apple is using Open Source as a puppet to achieve their own ends. Whenever Apple does something good is more by strategical manipulation that anything else.

So I heard from a VERY reliable source that ICQ does not really mind people plugging into their network. For instance there is a client called [trilian](http://www.trillian.cc/) that lets you: *"Communicate with Flexibility and Style. Trillian is everything you need for instant messaging. Connect to ICQ®, AOL Instant Messenger(SM), MSN Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger and IRC in a single, sleek and slim interface."*

So I agree that Jabber seems cool and maybe the next big thing, but what do I do with all of my old buddy lists? Also, if you're going to make me switch again, I'd like IP telephony seamlessly built into IM so that I don't have to have a phone number any more. It's stupid that the government in Japan allocates phone number when all you really need is a buddy list and an IM account.

*I have to figure out a cooler way of formating quotes from various people...* *How's this?*
