> Japan's figures rated poorly when compared with the results from Brazil (79 percent), Spain (76 percent), Germany (74 percent), Canada (73 percent), Italy (70 percent), the United States (67 percent), France (67 percent), Britain (59 percent) and China (57 percent).

I heard this sort of thing from Hirata who read it in a report from Mexico. I think it is true. It is counter-intuitive, but I think it really shows that the social fabric of Japan has broken down and that much of what we believe about Japan is wrong.
