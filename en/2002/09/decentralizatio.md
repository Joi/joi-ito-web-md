In case you missed this in my Toshio Yamagishi entry...

There is an interesting discussion going on in a [Yahoo Group called Decentraliation](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/decentralization/). [Rich Persaud made an interesting comment](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/decentralization/message/6081). [I responded](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/decentralization/message/6091). People asked me to post Toshio Yamagishi's paper so I got permission and here it is.

> You may do whatever you want to do with the paper.   
> Best regards,

I'm sorry if this is redundant, but I wanted to sort out this thread and make sure people saw Toshio Yamagishi's paper which is great.
