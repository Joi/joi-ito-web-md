I know blogging about blogs is getting a bit old, but [Frank Boosman](http://www.boosman.com/blog/) sent me a this piece by Ray Ozzie on blogs which I find quite good. It is short and interesting, focusing on the architecture of blogs vs. old fashioned database oriented conferencing systems and groupware.
