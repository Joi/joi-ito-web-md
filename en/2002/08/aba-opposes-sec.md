> The American Bar Association voted yesterday to oppose the Bush
> administration's secret detention of foreign nationals after the Sept. 11
> attacks, urging that their names be disclosed and they be given immediate
> access to lawyers and family members, Reuters reported.
>
> The nation's largest lawyers group joined civil libertarians and others
> who have criticized the government's policy of secret and prolonged
> detentions.
>
> In "Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Protecting Our Liberties While Fighting
> Terrorism," ( <http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-443es.html> ) Timothy Lynch,
> associate director of Cato's Center for Constitutional Studies, argues
> that government officials have typically responded to terrorist attacks by
> enacting "antiterrorism" legislation designed to assuage public fears by
> making "the dubious claim that they can prevent terrorism by curtailing
> the privacy and civil liberties of the people."
