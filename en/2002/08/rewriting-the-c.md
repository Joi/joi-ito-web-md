I am on the inquiry committee working on rewriting the basic consumer protection law. We are discussing enforcement. I mentioned the [FTC action against MS Passport](http://news.com.com/2100-1001-948922.html). We talked about how something like the [FTC](http://www.ftc.gov/ftc/consumer.htm) is essential in Japan. Currently the privacy bill being contemplated doesn't link with the consumer protection law and there is no body that can attack a problem like the MS Passport issue from the fair trade, consumer protection and privacy aspects as the FTC did in the US. I have 45 minutes left until the end of the meeting so if anyone has anything that I should mention here, please comment on my blog.
