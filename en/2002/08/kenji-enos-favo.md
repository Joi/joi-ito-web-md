[![mp-fro1-w240.jpg](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/mp-fro1-w240-thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/mp-fro1-w240.jpg)Kenji Eno ( [Justin wrote about him](http://www.links.net/vita/trip/japan/folks/kenji/) ) is guest blogging on my Japanese blog.

*translated by me from [Kenji Eno's entry](http://joi.ito.com/jp/archive/000331.html#000331)*

In 1987 JALECO (which PCCW Japan reverse merged into) made a game called "Moero!! Pro Baseball" for the Nintendo Famicon. It was an amazing game. At the time, Namco had a very popular game called Famista which sold very well. Morero!! Pro Baseball tried to make a very realistic game to compete against the very popular, but rather game-like Famista. The graphics were the only part that was realistic. You could bunt home runs, the strike zone was a complete mess... It was a horrible game. There was something twistedly special about the game that you really couldn't experience anywhere else. One could only love how bad it was. So I don't know if this guy is one of these types of fans, but this guy collects these 15 year old game cartridges of this game. There are many maniacs in the game community, many people buy 10 of their favorite games. That pales in comparison to this guy. So now you have to see his web site.
