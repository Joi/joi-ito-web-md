Had dinner with Dan Gillmor. He was in town for a few days to visit with Noriko-san. We had dinner at Kanayuni. We talked a lot about blogs and the future of the audience. I've been looking for a word for what Dan is called the "former audience." I told him that that sounds like "The artist formerly called Prince" and didn't really sound very good. I wish someone would come up with a word for it. The idea, for those of you who haven't been keeping up with our dialog is that the audience and the players are connecting directly and disintermediating the journalists. The audience and personal publishing is making the audience the media... etc.

I introduced Dan to Nishimura-san, the guy who runs [2ch](http://www.2ch.net/). He should be meeting with him this morning. That may turn into an interesting story. As blogs explode in the US, 2ch, the anonymous discussion site booms in Japan. I wonder if this is random or reflects a basic difference in Japanese and US culture. It is kind of cliche, but blogs are maybe better for opinionated people who want to become famous. ;-p
