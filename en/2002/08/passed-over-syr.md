[SatireWire | Passed Over, Syria, China, Libya Form Axis of Just As Evil](http://www.satirewire.com/news/jan02/axis.shtml)
  
January 2002
  
> Beijing (SatireWire.com) — Bitter after being snubbed for membership in the "Axis of Evil," Libya, China, and Syria today announced they had formed the "Axis of Just as Evil," which they said would be way eviler than that stupid Iran-Iraq-North Korea axis President Bush warned of his State of the Union address.
>   
>   
> Axis of Evil members, however, immediately dismissed the new axis as having, for starters, a really dumb name. "Right. They are Just as Evil... in their dreams!" declared North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. "Everybody knows we're the best evils... best at being evil... we're the best."

*From January. Was funnier when I first read it, but still funny and still sort of relevant. I promise this is my last Satirewire archive I'll post. Just been doing too much heavy reading and needed to refresh with something funny. And for people new to Satirewire, this should still be new.
