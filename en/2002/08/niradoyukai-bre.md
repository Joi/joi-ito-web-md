Yet another breakfast about how to save Japan... This one is co-sponsored by [The National Institute for Research Advancement (NIRA)](http://www.nira.go.jp/) and the [Association of Corporate Executives (*Keizai Doyukai*)](http://www.doyukai.or.jp/). The title of this project is called "The Action Plan for Reviving the Japanese Economy." The chair is Kanemaru-san, the CEO of [Future System Consulting](http://www.future.co.jp/).

This is the second breakfast. I presented my standard presentation at the last breakfast talking about the lack of a functioning market/risk-return model.

Now he's talking about music and raves in Israel...

This final point is to shift the "solid Japan" to a "liquid Japan"...

I just pointed out the risk of fluctuation amplification that comes risk speed and the necessity of diversity to dampen this and the fact that at some point speed is out of control and does not lead to straight forward "power" for the state.

Oe-san is talking about bottom up control rather than top-down control...

Jinno-sensei, Professor of Economics from Tokyo University agrees with me I think and is talking about getting "sea sick" from the speed and "slow down and calm down" for the economy...

Now we're talking about information and journalism and I got a chance to talk about blogs... I told everyone I was blogging them right now. ;-) (shocked faces)

We are now all agreeing that we have to destroy/purge a lot of the older structures, but now Inukai-san is asking, HOW do we destroy old structures...
