A [pretty funny article in Satirewire](http://www.satirewire.com/news/aug02/encryption.shtml). What is particularly amusing is that I sometimes think this. I know it is best practice to encrypt everything. (Otherwise it is obvious that encrypted messages are important.) But I've been having problems with PGP on my PC and sometimes I spend a great deal of effort to decrypt a message that just turns out to be some silly email that didn't NEED to be encrypted. ;-)

Of course, this is exactly the wrong position to take. We really should encrypt everything. This is not meant as a message for people to stop sending me stuff in encrypted form. It is just very funny because I often FEEL the same way.
> Surprisingly, computer security experts agree. "I get this all the time: 'Should I encrypt? I don't want anyone to steal my identity,'" said LockUpOnline President Bing D'aahl. "The textbook answer has been 'Yes,' but now we are advising people to first ask themselves, 'Do I have an identity that anyone would really want to steal?'"

If you answer truthfully, D'aahl said, chances are you'll forego the digital ID and save everyone a lot of trouble.
