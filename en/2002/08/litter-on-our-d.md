[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/trash_thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/trash.jpg)This morning was nice an cool after a rainy night. Mizuka and I went to get the morning paper and there was this homeless guy rustling around at the entrance to our home. It appeared like he was changing or something so we decided not to bother him and let him get dressed or whatever in peace. After quite awhile of what sounded like complete overhaul of his wearable computing gear, we heard him leave. When we got to the entrance where the paper is, we noticed a big mess. I wonder if the mess he left (some old rice, cat food and wrappers) was just laziness, a political statement of some sort, something he thought was funny, a work of art, a gift for us, or none of the above. In any event, we found it very annoying. I guess if he thought it was a gift, it would be kind of like what the Americans do to some countries. ;-p Anyway, the next time he comes back, maybe we should engage in some foreign policy and tell him that we in fact don't need any food, but that we are happy with him using our territory to organize his next movement as long as he leaves nothing behind.
