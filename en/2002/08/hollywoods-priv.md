Another article about the war on copyright offenders in the US. Found on David Farber's IP list. It really does show how much money really matters I guess.

The question for me is, where will all of the artists go. Will young people continue to want to become motion picture directors or musicians when it becomes more and more obvious that it is a very regulated business controlled by lawyers, the FBI and politicians? Their recent actions show that they are not protecting "artists" but the ability for large corporations to "monetize" artists.

Is the finally a chance for the rest of the world to leap frog the US while they are bogged down in a chaotic mess of copyright garbage? Will the US use it's global influence to prevent the rest of the world from creating an alternative universe of more advanced copyright thinking?

A July 25 letter sent to Attorney General  John Ashcroft by 19
American legislators asked him to devote more Justice Department resources
in the fight against peer-to-peer networks and users swapping digital media
without permission.

Forget the fact that the FBI is neck-deep in an internal crisis of confidence
and competence, having a hard time recruiting and keeping qualified agents,
and shifting from a diverse federal law enforcement entity to one in-line
with the emerging threats to American society from terrorism.

No, it seems that one of the highest priorities for the Justice Department
- behind that simple task of securing America's Homeland - should be copyright
enforcement....at least in the eyes of the Recording Industry Association
of America.  Of course, this is made all the easier when "peer-to-peer"
- a valuable technological architecture - is interpreted and subsequently
marketed by the RIAA as synonymous with "pirating" and evil economic -
potentially terrorist - activities against the $40 billion entertainment
industry. And, of course, Congress, mental wizards they are, will believe
whatever they're asked to believe, provided the campaign contributions
are the right type and amount.

We have the "War on Drugs" and the "War on AIDS" and the "War on Terror"
-- does this mean we'll see the "War on File Sharing" as the next great
American undertaking with the same effect as these other "Wars" over the
years?

When news of this bipartisan letter broke on Friday, RIAA CEO Hilary
Rosen, was, as always, quick to praise its contents, saying that mass
copying off the Internet is illegal and deserves to be a high priority
for the Department of Justice.  One wonders if she wears special
shoes to be able to jump so quickly to applaud anything that might in some
- any - way lead to profit assurance for her constituent record companies.

It was only last month that Rosen was quick to applaud the controversial
P2P-hack bill introduced by one of their owned Congressman, Rep. Howard
Berman (D-CA).  Among other things, the proposed bill (Register article
[here](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/26357.html)) would
create loopholes for cyber-criminals to potentially escape from and also
turn any authorized copyright holder into a potentially legal hacker. While
Rosen was more than happy to quickly jump in and praise the proposal, Berman's bill was so controversial that even Rosen's evil counterpart, Jack Valenti of the Motion Picture Association, took pause when the bill was introduced, noting that there are aspects of the bill we believe need changing as
it moves through the legislative process   -- implying that the powers
proposed in the Berman Bill - legalizing electronic attacks and providing
attacker immunity for liability in copyright enforcement activities --
were intended to be only for the large entertainment empires, not for any
copyright holder no matter how small.

Both the RIAA and MPAA act like drug addicts.....desperately begging
and trying to get something - anything - to help their body's craving for
their addictive substances, but it's the RIAA that takes first prize in
the desperate-moves category.  Declining sales of albums - and their
profits - have been equated to Napster, peer-to-peer file sharing, Webcasting,
MP3 file formats, and the fact all PCs now come with a CD burner as standard
issue.....anything but the fact that studios have produced less and less
quality music that folks want to buy, or that studios are more than happy
to negotiate ludicrous contracts with artists that only deliver mediocre
album sales (\*cough\* Mariah Carey) or one-hit wonders. They've happily
saturated the pop market with teen bands that look, dance, and sound so
alike it's impossible to tell them apart. They also forget that CD prices
have gone up steadily over the past decade - and that when the economy
takes a downturn, paying $20 for a song or two is not worth it to most
people. Further, their efforts so far in providing music over the Internet
- to 'compensate' for the loss of Napster - makes current Afghanistan politics
look like a utopian form of government.

Granted, organized piracy (as opposed to individual copying and/or sharing)
has caused Hollywood some economic damage, but I don't see Hilary, Jack,
Lars, or studio executives standing on lines outside soup kitchens. And
the fact that someone copies or uses a CD under federal fair-use laws doesn't
present a significant economic impact to the entertainment industry, either.
If anything, casual and legal sharing of music helps broaden an artist's
publicity and generate "buzz" -  much how Microsoft software became
so dominant in the marketplace -- not through quality, but because everyone
was using it and it became the de facto standard, such that it is.

Rosen says that piracy "ultimately hurts consumers by undermining the
creators' incentive to bring new works to the market.   In her eyes
- and in the eyes of her purchased lawmakers - the only 'creators' that
should be allowed to easily bring new works to market are those under contract
to RIAA's member companies. To RIAA, you're either part of their [cartel](http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=cartel)
or you don't matter.

Thus, we see proposals like Berman's bill, and the RIAA suggesting that
all blank compact disks (and possibly hard drives) be taxed to compensate
for piracy losses, even if such media are used for the backup of software
and user data, not entertainment content. Most sinister is the recent proposal
by Senator Fritz "Hollywood" Hollings that would mandate copyright enforcement
'features' be part of any device that can store electronic data, from computers
and DVD players to microwaves, garage door openers, and rectal thermometers.
The Hollings proposal would essentially force the interests of the $40
billion entertainment industry on the $500 billion-plus technology and
hardware industries in a variety of industrial sectors. Talk about the
mouse trying to own the elephant herd.

As users and customers (note I did not say "consumers" - "customers"
implies a mutually-beneficial two-way relationship), we have every right
to bemoan the obvious profiteering actions of these entertainment cartels
to squeeze every last dime from our wallets. Sure, we will pay for quality
music that's affordable, but we want a happy medium where we have the flexibility
to use the entertainment content legally purchased and/or obtained in a
manner consistent with the law and our expectations. Yet the entertainment
cartels are only too happy to lobby for laws and technological controls
that presume every customer a potential criminal until it can be proven
with certainty.  That's to be expected from Industrial Age business
leaders - known otherwise as "The Greed Generation."

However, that's not the problem with the whole copyright enforcement
debate. Sure, profits are involved, but there's much more at-stake than
what's being discussed in Congress or the online communities.

Freedom of choice in how one is able to bring his content to market
means a greater chance of it reaching an audience. Up until Napster, the
entertainment industry alone decided what artist gets supported, promoted,
and published, and in what quantities. The Information Age threatens to
reverse this centralized control mechanism and profit stream, enabling
anyone to publish and promote their content around the world, cutting the
middleman - RIAA and major studios - out of the financial equation and
management process. Nobody in an established role likes to lose control,
be voted out of office, or see their authority and influence erode....yet
this is exactly what the Information Age is doing to the centralized entertainment
industry. This helps explain some of the goofy proposals mentioned earlier
-- like a Vegas gambler, the RIAA (and MPAA by extension) is hedging its
bets, trying to not only maintain control of the content and media industry,
but if it can't, get as much as it can through other methods, laws, and
charges.

If you control the means to disseminate content, you can subsequently
control the public. If you can't afford - or are not willing - to play
by the 'established' means of control, you are typically left to fend for
yourself in local venues and audiences.

Thanks to the Information Age, this is not the case anymore. This harsh
reality terrifies the entertainment industry that will stop at nothing
- no matter how ill-conceived - to keep its reign despite a failing business
model and changing economic and customer environment. The copyright debate
isn't only about profit, it's also about who controls information, and
ultimately, people and society.
