[![Read and Release at BookCrossing.com...](http://bookcrossing.com/images/BookCrossingLink1-130x45.gif)](http://bookcrossing.com/)Scott just sent me email about this site. This is very cool. It is a book club with 60,000 readers and 30,000 books. The idea is that when you finish reading a book, you tag it and leave it on a street corner, coffee shop or what ever and post it on the site and the next person can find it and read it. When you find books and read them, you add journal entries which become part of a huge database of over 10,000 reviews and recommendations. Sounds pretty cool to me. I'm going to sign up today. This reminds me a bit of <http://www.geocaching.com/>, the gps scavenger hunt site...
