[Engin01](http://www.enjin01.org/), the cultural non-profit that I helped start is having an offsite meeting at one of the most famous temples in Japan, [Koyasan](http://www.koyasan.org/). There are no hotels to stay in, just temples. I will be staying in a temple with Mizuka, Yanai-san of [Pia](http://www.pia.co.jp/) and his wife Makiko-san. I will be bringing my camera and computer, so I may be able to bring my blog with me, but if I am out of touch for a few days, sorry! I'll upload stuff when I get back.
