Found this strange site that has extracted data from conference attendances and created graphical maps of social network. Pretty scary. I attended an [Open Source Solutions](http://www.oss.net/extra/page/) conference organized by Robert Steele, a former CIA expert on Open Source Intelligence. There were a bunch of CIA and KGB folks at the conference. Anyway, the list of attendants of this conference among other lists seem to have made it into this database...
