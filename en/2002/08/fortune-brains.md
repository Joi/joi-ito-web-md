So it 4:40am in Aspen and I'm going through cards and notes from the conference. Overall, it was one of the best conferences I've attended. I think they invited a little over 100 people. All of the people were very high quality and the format of the sessions were great, although the scheduling was a bit out of control. On the other hand, I guess that can be expected to a certain extent considering the egos of the people who were speaking. ;-) I had 2 false starts for my blurb and when I was suddenly told to present, I was still a bit groggy from having just woken up. I didn't feel I was at my best which was a bit of a bummer, but I guess we should all be able to speak on short notice.
  
  
I think the number of people is important for conferences. With 100+ people, it is likely you will get to meet almost everyone you want to meet. One of the problems with the World Economic Forum is that with over 2000 people, it takes quite a bit of effort to get around to everyone you want to see and the mood is less cozy.
  
  
I doubt Fortune Magazine would consider me a publication, but I'm assuming that they will want to keep most of the content for their October and November issues so look forward to seeing some cool things in Fortune about the conference. I'll try to blog the articles and add my perspectives then.
  
  
Personally, my understanding and sense of closeness to the conflict in the Middle East, the HIV problem, ecology and poverty were dramatically increased. (More things to think about! Oh no!)
  
  
It was also amazing to meet all of the Silicon Valley VC gurus, human rights leaders, government leaders and CEO's all in one place. It was great seeing the Minister of Women's Issues of Afghanistan getting support from the philanthopists who were in attendance.
  
  
Anyway, I hope they do it again and invite me again. It was a blast.
