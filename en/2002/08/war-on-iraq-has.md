It appears that the war on Iraq has already begun. According to the Israeli web site called DEBKAfile who claim, "We Start Where The Media Stop," the war has been slowly onfolding "salami style" in small slices. Where is the Western press coverage of this? I remember that warnings of terrorists attacks on US targets were rumored to have been written about in Israeli press before 9/11. Maybe I should start reading the Israeli underground press more for my military news! Attached is a quote from their [web site](http://www.debka.com/).

> 1. Tuesday August 6, at 0800 hours Middle East time, US and British air bombers went into action and destroyed the Iraqi air command and control center at al-Nukhaib in the desert between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The center contained advanced fiber optic networks recently installed by Chinese companies. DEBKA-Net-Weekly's military sources say the raid made military history. For the first time, the US air force used new precision-guided bombs capable of locating and destroying fiber optic systems. The existence of such weaponry was hitherto unknown.

> Following the destruction of the facility, about 260 miles (415 kilometers), southwest of Baghdad, waves of US warplanes swept in from the Prince Sultan air base in Saudi Arabia and from US aircraft carriers in the Gulf and flew over the Iraqi capital.

> The Iraqi air force and anti-aircraft system held their fire on orders from above. This deep air penetration told the Americans that the early warning radar system protecting Baghdad and its environs from intrusion by enemy aircraft and missiles was inactive.

>   
> 2. Two days later, on Wednesday night, August 8, Turkey executed its first major military assault inside Iraq. DEBKAfile's military sources learn from Turkish and Kurdish informants that helicopters under US, British and Turkish warplane escort flew Turkish commandos to an operation for seizing the critical Bamerni airport in northern Iraq. This airport, just outside the Kurdish region, lies 50 miles north of the big Iraqi oil cities of the north, Kirkuk and Mosul. With the Turkish commandos was a group of US special forces officers and men. Bamerni airport was captured after a brief battle in which a unit of Iraqi armored defenders was destroyed, opening the airport for giant American and Turkish transports to deliver engineering units, heavy machinery and electronic support equipment, which were put to work at once on enlarging the field and widening its landing strips.

I just got the following email from Louis:
  
  
*This report may be true, but DEBKA is a \_notoriously\_ unreliable source, equivalent basically to a fantasy news source (like fantasy baseball). You should know.

So, now I don't know whether to believe this, but I'm going to keep digging for more coverage.
