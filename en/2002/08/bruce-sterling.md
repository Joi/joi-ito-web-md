[Bruce Sterling Viridian Note 00325: Open Source Speech](http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/301-350/00325_open_source_speech.html)

> **Key concepts:** O'Reilly Open Source convention, computation, free software, Linux, spam, viruses, means of software production, social organization, Disney, Microsoft, Richard Stallman, Lawrence Lessig, information economics
>
> **Attention Conservation Notice:** Over 5,400 words of diffuse Papal-Imperial ranting to a restive audience of Linux freaks.
>
> ##### "A Contrarian View of Open Source"
>
> San Diego July 26, 2002
>
> Thanks for showing up to see the obligatory novelist at this gig.

> It's very touching of you to take the trouble to watch me get some emotional issues off my chest.

> You know, I don't write code. I don't think I'm ever going to write any code. It just amazes me how often people who know absolutely nothing about code want to tell software people their business. "Why don't they just," that's the standard phraseology. "Why don't they just" code-up something-or-other. Whenever I hear that, frankly, I just want to slap the living shit out of those people.

> That's like people whose fingers are covered with diamonds complaining about the easy lives of diamond miners.
