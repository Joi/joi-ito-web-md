I've been flamed several times in Cypherpunks. This notes is Vulis offhandedly taking a stab at me after I jumped on (and was jumped on by) Tim May for mocking Nakatsuji's bad English. At the end of the day, Nakatsuji had it coming after a flurry of stupid messages, but I didn't think it was fair for Tim to make fun of his English. Tim got attacked by many on the list, but I doubt it concerned him much. While we were at it, I got Vulis on my tail. Typical Cypherpunk action I guess.
