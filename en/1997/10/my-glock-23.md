This is a picture of me with my Glock 23 at the [Frontsight Firearms Training Institute](http://www.frontsight.com/FirearmsTraining/). I learned a great deal about guns and the people who like guns. I found myself liking guns a lot after the 4 day course in the desert. The class was great and I appreciate Lucky Green who turned me on to guns.

Just an interesting thing I've noticed... Computer vulnerability cracker/hackers tend to like pornography a lot. Crytographers seem to really like guns. Makes sense I guess.
