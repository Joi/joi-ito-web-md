In [Airport 'Pat-Downs' and Fear of Retaliation](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/011047.shtml), Dan Gillmor links to a New York Times  [story](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/23/business/23grope.html?ei=5090&en=ef0aa5afe853064f&ex=1258866000&partner=rssuserland&pagewanted=all&position=) about U.S. airport screening and women who are humiliated but afraid to retaliate. This is how profiling and lists will begin to inhibit our actions and free speech. What's your national ID # again?
