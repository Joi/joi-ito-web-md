I remember someone posting a graphic of how an idea spreads across blogs. the image had a "gray area" of instant messenger and email that couldn't be tracked as easily. I've asked a few people who remember seeing the post, but now no one can find it. Does anyone remember it and have the URL? It's amazing that we remember it, but can't find it or remember who posted it...

UPDATE: [Found](http://hammeroftruth.com/2004/03/08/how-news-travels-on-the-internet)! Thanks tarek! Amazing. That was less than one hour after I posted this question. I had been googling for it for a day or so.
