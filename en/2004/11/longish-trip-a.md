I'm off to Paris today for some meetings, to Cape Town for the [ICANN meeting](http://www.icanncapetown.co.za/), SF for some meetings then Boston for the [Votes, Bits and Bytes meeting](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/is2k4/index.html) at Harvard Law School. As usual, [my schedule is on my wiki](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/?joi_s_travel). Also, my apologies to the environment...

PS My trip to SF is VERY short trip. I'll be back for a more leisurely visit in January and will hook up with everyone then.
