Apologies to anyone who tried to access this blog in the last 24 hours. It looks like it was another malicious attack. I don't know if someone is after me in particular, or if I've randomly stumbled across two denial-of-service attacks in one week. But why would anyone want to take out MY blog? Oh, maybe I'm affecting the elections in the US... not.
