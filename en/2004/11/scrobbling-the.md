As some may have noticed, [Boris](http://bopuc.levendis.com/weblog/) and [Ado](http://blog.kung-foo.tv/) ([he doesn't have a very good sense of humor, but he tries](http://blog.kung-foo.tv/archives/001212.php)) are fiddling with including my the recent songs I've played on my sidebar taken from [my last.fm profile](http://www.last.fm/user/joi). I've turned [scrobbling](http://www.audioscrobbler.com/) on so that it picks up the songs I'm playing now. When I'm scrobbling, I realize that I skip stupid songs so they don't end up in my profile. Now I have to take a shower. I'm going to leave iTunes on in shuffle mode. I sure hope it doesn't play anything too stupid or embarrassing while I'm away.
