[merkinofbaphomet posts on AnandTech](http://forums.anandtech.com/messageview.aspx?catid=52&threadid=1410716) that he just noticed that no abuse images show up on Google Images when you [search for Abu Ghraib](http://images.google.com/images?q=abu+ghraib&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&safe=off&start=20&sa=N). The [same search on Alta Vista](http://www.altavista.com/image/results?itag=wrx&q=abu+ghraib&kgs=1&kls=0) produces a bunch of images.

I DO know that Google Images doesn't refresh their image database that frequently. Is it just that the images haven't made it into the database yet? Does anyone have more info on this? Can someone from Google shed some light?
