> We'd like to produce a short, [new animated/motion graphics film](http://creativecommons.org/learnmore), and we need a great designer and/or animator to help us do so on a fairly tight deadline. You should know how to animate in Flash or After Effects (or both) and have experience with any necessary drawing tools, like Adobe Illustrator. You should have the confidence and skill to help us produce a film of at least the caliber of [our previous pieces](http://creativecommons.org/learnmore). No need to be a writer (we'll collaborate on the script) or an audio engineer (though if you are one or know one, that's great). Location in the Bay Area and enthusiasm for the work of Creative Commons are big bonuses. Send an email ASAP to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) if you are interested. Please include (1) a CV, (2) a list of the animated or graphic design pieces you've done, (3) a link to any such pieces that are now online, and (4) all your contact information. Thanks!

If you can help or know someone who can, please pass this info on. Thanks.
