The [ICANN](http://www.icann.org/) Staff and President and CEO have recently made a strategic plan available. It's quite complete and probably interesting for anyone interested in ICANN. It's a [70+ page PDF](http://www.icann.org/strategic-plan/strategic-plan-16nov04.pdf). Any comments or opinions about it would be greatly appreciated.
