The name of the image file is asshole.jpg. Nice catch Jonas.

UPDATE [Sean blogs that The Register ripped off the article without giving credit to Jonas](http://www.seanbonner.com/blog/archives/001093.php#001093). Schmucks.

UPDATE2 Now [WorldNetDaily](http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=41291) is writing as if they found it.

UPDATE3 [derStandard.at has also just ripped off the images without attribution.](http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=1848408)

UPDATE4 Jonas had an attribution-ShareAlike license on his blog...
