There is an [interesting discussion going on on MetaFilter](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/37105) about a very graphic video of what appears to be French soldiers shooting at civilians in Cote d'Ivoire. The discussion starts with understandable outrage, but some people begin to question the authenticity of the video and question whether it might be propaganda from the Gbagbo government. There is more and more political video on the Internet and it clearly is more emotional than text. Well respected groups such as [Witness](http://witness.org/) have been using video to expose human rights issues for awhile now. It will be interesting to see if/when/how not so respectable groups begin using video on the Internet for political issues or to spin the truth.

I can't conclude either way about exactly what is going on after watching [this video](http://radioci.embaci.com/englishdownload/frenchsoldiersshootingcivilians2.mpg). (Warning 100MB and very graphic.)

UPDATE: [tao](http://www.1monde.net/) posts a link to an interview of French military on Swiss TV in Real Video format. <http://clubidf.free.fr/rm/CI-carnage.rm> Can someone who speaks French tell us what they are saying?
