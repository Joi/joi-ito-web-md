[Ejovi was prevented from giving his talk](http://www.ejovi.net/archives/2004/11/japanese_govern.html) by the Japanese [Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications](http://www.soumu.go.jp/english/index.html). Ejovi did the security audit on the local government system connected to the Japanese National ID system (Jyukinet) for the prefecture of Nagano. I [audited his audit and wrote an opinion for Governor of Nagano last December](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/12/19/my_letter_to_the_governor_of_nagano_about_his_security_audit.html). It does suck that they blocked is talk, which I think would have been fair and balanced as Ejovi says. However, I can easily imagine the government taking a hard stance on this considering all of the trouble they are having controlling the spin. Anyway, welcome to my world Ejovi. Ejovi, if you really want to give this talk, I think you need to do it with some political backup like Nagano or another local government.
