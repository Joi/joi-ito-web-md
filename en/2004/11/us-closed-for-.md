I watched [The Terminal](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362227/) on the flight to Paris because I knew it was about [Merhan Karimi Nasseri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merhan_Karimi_Nasseri) stuck in Charles de Gaulle Airport. I didn't realize that the movie was set in the US and the story totally "rebuilt". I enjoyed the movie, but it was definitely Hollywoodified and wasn't based on the Merhan Karimi Nasseri story, but rather just inspired by it.
