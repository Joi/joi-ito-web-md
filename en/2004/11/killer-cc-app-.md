> Leveraging the [Internet Archive's](http://archive.org/) generous offer to host Creative Commons licensed (audio and video) files for free, we recently completed the 0.96 beta version of **The Publisher**, a desktop, drag-and-drop application that licenses audio and video files, and sends them to the Internet Archive for free hosting.
>
> When you're done uploading, the application gives you a URL where others can download the file. It also is able to [tag MP3 files with Creative Commons metadata](http://creativecommons.org/technology/embedding) and publish verification metadata to the Web. A HUGE congratulations to [Nathan Yergler](http://creativecommons.org/about/people#31), who's done an amazing job with this. Also, a great thanks to Jon Aizen and the folk at the Internet Archive. You can [download the Publisher from here](http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/software/publisher/) -- give it a test run and let us know what you think.
>
> Also note that aside from being downloadable from Internet Archive, these tagged MP3s can flow on to P2P networks, and be identified as Creative Commons licensed (see [our Lookup app](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4476) we recently also [updated to 0.96](http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/software/lookup/)). [Morpheus](http://www.morpheus.com/) is currently the only file sharing application to identify Creative Commons licensed files.

I'm definitely going to start using this. Amazing. Thanks again everyone!
