The movie that I'm helping on, "Negotiator - Mashita Masayoshi" is going to start shooting next week. I need to find more stickers that I can use for the laptop computers of the villain and the cyber-crime team. They need to be cool stickers and the rights have to be cleared. If you have any stickers that you have made or are with some group that would be interested in having stickers on a laptop in a Japanese movie, please email me the artwork or send me the actual stickers. Please also tell me what it represents and the story behind it if there is one. The director will make the final decision on whether to use the sticker based on the meaning, story behind the sticker and how cool it looks.

My address is:   
Neoteny Co., Ltd., Plaza Mikado 3F, 2-14-5 Akasaka, Minato-ku, Tokyo 107-0052 Japan

or jito (at) neoteny.com.

There is now [a web site for the movie](http://www.odoru-legend.com/), but there is still not much there.
