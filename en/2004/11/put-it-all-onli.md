I had the opportunity of sitting with [Ismail Serageldin](http://www.serageldin.com/), the director of the [Library of Alexandria](http://www.bibalex.org/English/index.aspx) at a session at the [STS Forum](http://www.stsforum.org/). He told me a story about a fellow educator and librarian who was dismayed that students were only citing things that they could find on the Internet and were no longer using physical libraries. Ismail said that he disagreed. He told me that he felt that students using the Internet were correct and that it was the libraries that needed to make more material available online. I totally agree. (He also said he was a fan of [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/).) So it's good news that:

Great news for the public domain: [The National Endowment for the Arts and the Library of Congress are putting 30 million newspaper pages online, dating from 1836 to 1922](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/apwashington_story.asp?category=1155&slug=Old%20Newspapers).

It'll take until 2006 to complete the project but the Library of Congress has put up [a sample from The Stars and Stripes](http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/sgphtml/sashtml/sashome.html), an armed forces paper, posting every issue from 1918-1919.
