Just finished my RSS feed and didn't find anything I felt I needed to comment on so I'll give you my two favorite links from today.

From the mistress of the cute/cool thing, [Andrea Harner](http://www.andreaharner.com/), comes [modernpooch.com](http://www.modernpooch.com/).

Warren Ellis over at [die puny humans](http://www.diepunyhumans.com) informs us that:

> [It's a glum day for optimists. After 24 years of community service, the Quakertown Optimists Club is calling it quits. They're holding their last meeting on Thursday, citing declining interest.](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=816&e=1&u=/ap/20041129/ap_on_fe_st/sad_optimists)

"I feel sad," club president Bernard Kensky said.

"Four or five people would come to meetings and only two or three people would help out with the activities. I don't know why people stopped getting involved."
