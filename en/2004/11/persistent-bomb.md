I am still getting bombarded from IP address 82.165.28.20 which is [plasmaxx-research.de](http://plasmaxx-research.de/). My most recent outage was a a more "formal" attack, but my the cause of my first outage on bloghosts was caused by these requests from 82.165.28.20. It's basically a request for my index.xml about 15 times a minute. Not really hardcore and we are now filtering the requests, but still annoying. It might be a hoard of news readers, but the requests keep coming even after we've banned them and redirected the requests back to Plasmaxx. Anyone know who Plasmaxx Research is? There is no contact info on their page or in the whois. I suppose that if it is indeed an attack, the perpetrator is not actually from Plasmaxx Research. Anyway, if anyone knows anyone from Plasmaxx research, can you tell them to please stop bombarding me.
