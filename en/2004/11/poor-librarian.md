[Funny anti-blog anti-Wikipedia article by a librarian Greg Hill](http://www.news-miner.com/Stories/0,1413,113~7244~2536204,00.html) who manages to mangle the spelling of Dan Gillmor and Dave Barry's name while trying to argue that "librarians abhor using reference sources that don't have established credibility editorial rigor..." ;-)

I don't usually like to link to stupid articles, but this one's too ironic to just ignore.

> UPDATE: Trudy Schuett posted an extraordinary [exchange of e-mails](http://wolves.typepad.com/wolves/2004/11/alaskan_brain_f.html) with the Alaska librarian, who has the nerve to say he knows of "no typos or mis-statements in that column, unless they are those of the sources I cite, and every point in my column stemmed from multiple sources. As a rule, there's not enough space in a 700-word column to list multiple sources, but I can readily produce them."

> No, he can't. He can't possibly produce a citation that explains misspelling my name and Dave Barry's. He might alibi getting the name of my book wrong, because he quotes an early working title that I used in blog postings here. But even there, a tiny amount of due diligence would have produced the correct title.

> I worship librarians as a rule, but I'm going to make an exception in this case.

Truely unbelievable.
