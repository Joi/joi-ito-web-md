I'm at the airport now and I'm on my way to Israel. I have a 14 hour flight to Paris, a 5 hour layover and then another 4 hours plus flight to Tel Aviv. Long flight.

The influenza vaccination I took is making me feel sick I think. It feels like I have half a dozen mini-flus at the same time. Symptoms of a bunch of different flus but mini versions. Blah.

Since I have five hours in Charles de Gaulle Airport, maybe I should look for [Merhan Karimi Nasseri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merhan_Karimi_Nasseri), the Iranian refugee who has been living in the airport since 1988. I wonder if he'll let me moblog him. Or even... a podcast interview. I suppose my "boy am I sick of airports" line won't really fly with him.

Anyway, if anyone is in Charles de Gaulle between 4:35 AM and 10:30AM on Nov 7, let me know.
