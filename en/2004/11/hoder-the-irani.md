[Hoder, the Iranian blogger is getting death threats](http://hoder.com/weblog/archives/012691.shtml).

> Now they've [moved to BlogSpot](http://islamic-army.blogspot.com/) and have made another blog with the same name with a more precise content to backup their claims. They now have picked particular posts from my Persian blog, in which they think I've insulted the God, and other sacred concepts of Islam and therefore, quoting from a [Quranic verse](http://islamicarmy.blogspot.com/2004/11/httpislamic-army.html), I deserve to be killed.

I will be meeting Hoder for the first time at the upcoming Berkman Center's "[Internet & Society 2004: Votes, Bits & Bytes](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/is2k4/index.html)" on December 10. This will be Hoder's first trip to the US. I hope it turns out to be enjoyable for him and doesn't cause him problems at home. I always have to remind myself that for some people, things we take for granted like "free speech" are life threatening activities in some countries.
