> Ray Bradbury is one of the great science fiction writers. But in his advancing years he's also acting in a fairly petty manner.

> The author of the brilliant novel "Fahrenheit 451" is claiming to [anyone who'll listen](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2004/06/18/entertainment2219EDT0805.DTL) (AP) that Michael Moore has somehow committed an act of intellectual theft by naming his new movie "Fahrenheit 9/11" without asking permission.

Don't you hate it when your favorite writers do, write or say stupid things?

This reminds me of the horror of reading Orson Scott Card's homophobic essay, ["Homosexual "Marriage" and Civilization"](http://www.ornery.org/essays/warwatch/2004-02-15-1.html).
