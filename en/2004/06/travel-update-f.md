Sorry about the light blogging. Have been a bit distracted with my travels.

British Midland lost my bag on a direct flight from Naples to Heathrow. Unsure who's fault it was, but no apology (not that I expected one) from anyone. Luckily, it arrived that night.

Staying at the [Park Lane Hotel](http://www.starwood.com/sheraton/search/hotel_detail.html?propertyID=105) on Piccadilly. Looked like a nice room at first glance, but the fax machine was broken, room safe broken (they've tried to fix it 3 times, still broken), drippy faucet, door lock broken (took 24 hours to fix), wifi in room, but a credit card based T-Mobile network with spotty coverage in my room.

The room is much better than many places I've stayed, but it would be SO MUCH better if they just had their shit together a bit more. (Maybe it's because I'm using mileage to pay for the room...)  
Anyway, I expected much better from a "five star" London hotel. What a pity. I'm never going to stay at this hotel again.

On the bright side, I've gotten to meet a bunch of the UK bloggers and so far the food is MUCH BETTER than I remember it from visiting years ago.
