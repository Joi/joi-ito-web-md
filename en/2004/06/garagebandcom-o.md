> [GarageBand.com](http://www.garageband.com/) -- a site that both hosts independent music and uses a peer-review process to identify hot bands -- is offering the Creative Commons [Music Sharing License](http://creativecommons.org/license/music) to artists who want to distribute their tunes for free, the company said Monday.

Nice. GarageBand is one of the biggest legal mp3 sites and it's cool that they are offering a CC license to their artists. Alternative distribution of music using CC licenses is clearly a good idea and helps people understand the whole [Free Culture](http://free-culture.org/) concept. I really do believe that the issue will become more and more about how to gain attention, not how to charge for delivery. It is changing from a delivery problem to a discovery problem as storage and bandwidth become commodities. Discovery is cheap only when you have a monopoly on people's attention. Obviously, media companies like [Clear Channel](http://www.clearchannel.com/) are trying to keep that monopoly, but I think users are going to dump those locked up modes as new modes of discovery become available. I think that the main way to get attention will be to become part of the conversation and you can only do that if you promote active sharing of your music and content.
