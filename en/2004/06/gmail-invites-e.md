People have been auctioning Google gmail invitations on eBay. [Jonas has set up a gmail invitation exchange](http://www.jluster.org/node/view/134) for people who donate invitations and for people willing to do something "good" in exchange for an invite.

> It's not free, however. If you're interested in one, comment here and let me know what you're willing to do for it. Not to me (though I am more than ready to trade for a few good massages), but to someone else. A random act of kindness, maybe? Work in a soup kitchen? Help out at a needle exchange? Or maybe you're doing that already - you'd be the ideal recipient.
