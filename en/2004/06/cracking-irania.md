[Bruce Schneier has written an interesting article](http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0406.html#1) discussing the accusation of Ahmed Chalabi of informing Iran that the US had broken its codes and when Iran knew that the NSA was cracking their codes. He digs into the history of Crypto AG, the NSA and Iran. He links to an [article about Hans Buehler](http://www.aci.net/kalliste/speccoll.htm), the Crypto AG salesman who was arrested by Iran in 1992 on suspicion that Crypto AG had installed back doors in its encryption machines. There is no conclusion, but this story reminds me of [Crytonomicon](http://www.cryptonomicon.com/main.html) and the interesting world of information, misinformation and spying.
