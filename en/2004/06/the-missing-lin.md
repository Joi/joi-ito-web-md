Thanks to [all of the newspapers that picked up](http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&edition=us&ie=ascii&q=joi+ito&btnG=Search+News&filter=0) the somewhat embarrassingly nice article by Yuri Kageyama of AP. AP syndication is really amazing.

One thing. The article doesn't contain links to [Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/), [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) and [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com/) mentioned in the article.
