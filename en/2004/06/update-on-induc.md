> I hadn't been taking some proposed new copyright legislation very seriously, mainly because it's logically absurd on its face. But the ["Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act of 2004"](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/COE04694_LC.pdf) (PDF) seems to be moving so quickly that we have to pay attention now.

It's basically a bill that can make the creation of technology that could possibly be used for "piracy" illegal. More on Dan's blog. Please take a look. It's quite absurd and dangerous. If it's moving quickly, I think we need to mobilize against it as soon as possible. Japan always gets hand-me-downs of ugly US bills so please stop it!
