[flickr](http://www.flickr.com/), a photo management/social network/community/chat service [just integrated Creative Commons](http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2004/06/creative_common.html) so you can choose a license for a photo when you upload this. This is awesome. flickr integrates photos into your chat so that you can plop photos into a chat room from your shoe-box and copy photos into your shoe-box from a conversation. People can comment on the photos, etc. It's probably the best integration of photos in conversation that I've ever seen and now with [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org/), it should make feel safer and more fluid.

Nice job Stewart!
