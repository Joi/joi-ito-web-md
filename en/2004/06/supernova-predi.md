I'm going to try to help plan a dinner/party that I can't attend. David Beckemeyer et al to are working on [Heckelbot](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/07/13/david_beckemeyer_built_a_hecklebot.html) so I can be there virtually. The dinner/party is scheduled for June 23, the day before [Supernova 2004](http://www.pulver.com/supernova/) at the Westin in Santa Clara. I ALWAYS go to Supernova, but this year I just can't make it since I have to be in Tokyo for a shareholders meeting.

[Here a wiki page for the planning.](http://www.socialtext.net/supernova/index.cgi?Joi%20Ito%27s%20pre-conference%20party)

Speaking of Supernova, I'm hoping I will be able to participate in the conference via rigged Hecklebot as well. Stay tuned for more on this. ;-)
