From the company that pioneered text messaging, picture messaging and multimedia messaging, comes new innovation - Wave Messaging, or Light Messaging, according to a Nokia [press release](http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=SVBIZINK1.story&STORY=/www/story/05-31-2004/0002184172&EDATE=MON+May+31+2004,+05:59+AM)

By waving the [Nokia 3220](http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,8764,58565,00.html) camera phone from side to side, the LED lights of the Nokia Xpress-on FunShell light up to "write" a message that appears to float in mid-air.

-- In March 2003, the WSJ reported from CeBIT about a phone called Kurv, made by Kyocera Wireless Corp which featured airtexting: "The company believes [airtexting](http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/000092.htm) will be one of it's most popular features, especialy in night clubs. To airtext, you type in a text like 'call me' then wave it back and forth in the air. As the phone moves, a row of blinking red lights along the top of the phone leaves the phrase trailing behind it."

-- A company called [Wildseed](http://www.wildseed.com/index.htm) actually tested [airtexting with teenagers](http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/000092.htm).If they made an airtexting enabled BlackBerry, I wonder if they would allow them in Congress. With the massive penetration of BlackBerries [(NYT - A BlackBerry Throbs, and a Wonk Has a Date)](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/30/fashion/30BLAC.html?ex=1401249600&en=50c6307ef79adda2&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND</p>

<p>), it would be like a chorus of [Hecklebots](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/07/13/david_beckemeyer_built_a_hecklebot.html). Anyway, I want one. Forget night clubs, imaging having one in the audience during talks.
