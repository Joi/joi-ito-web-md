> In one of the uglier "intellectual property" abuses, DirecTV has been [suing people](http://www.directvdefense.org/) for possession of tools it claims can be used to get TV shows without paying for them. The [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://www.eff.org/) and Stanford Law School's [Center for Internet and Society](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/) have challenged the satellite TV company on this conduct, and on Monday DirecTV agreed to modify its approach, according to this [press release](http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2004_06.php#001615), which says in part:
> > *The company will no longer pursue people solely for purchasing smart card readers, writers, general-purpose programmers, and general-purpose emulators. It will maintain this policy into the forseeable future and file lawsuits only against people it suspects of actually pirating its satellite signal. DirecTV will, however, continue to investigate purchasers of devices that are often primarily designed for satellite signal interception, nicknamed “bootloaders” and “unloopers.”
> >
> > DirecTV also agreed to change its pre-lawsuit demand letters to explain in detail how innocent recipients can get DirecTV to drop their cases. The company also promised that it will investigate every substantive claim of innocence it receives. If purchasers provide sufficient evidence demonstrating that they did not use their devices for signal theft, DirecTV will dismiss their cases. EFF and CIS will monitor reports of this process to confirm that innocent device purchasers are having their cases dismissed.*

> Perhaps DirecTV saw some writing on the wall. On Tuesday, a federal appeals court has [ruled](http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200315313.pdf) that the company can't sue solely because someone possesses such equipment.

These are the kinds of stories that make me sometimes wish I lived in America. Good job EFF and Stanford Law School.
