Some people have been critical about the lack of fact checking and vetting I do before I post an article or a link. I've argued that my posts are really the beginning of a discussion and not a definitive assertion or the final word. I really think about my blog as a group effort with the people who comment here.

I was reading Yochai Benkler's paper, "[Coase's Penguin, or Linux and the Nature of the Firm](http://www.benkler.org/CoasesPenguin.html)", (which I highly recommend) and saw a reference to this from Slashdot's FAQ which I think sums up my feelings as well.

> Q: How do you verify the accuracy of Slashdot stories?

> A: We don't. You do. :) If something seems outrageous, we might look for some corroboration, but as a rule, we regard this as the responsibility of the submitter and the audience. This is why it's important to read comments. You might find something that refutes, or supports, the story in the main.

Agreed, a blog is a bit different from slashdot, but please. Read the comments. That's where most of the really interesting stuff goes on.
