[I had fun with some photoshopping last night](http://chocnvodka.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2004/6/15/88708.html), but this morning someone showed me [a site of a photoshop-a-rama on the new MEP from Finland, Alexander Stubb](http://www.stealthunit.net/message.aspx?intBoardID=3&intMessageID=158580). Too bad most blogs don't allow images in comments anymore. It's such a ... "creative" form of communication. ;-)
