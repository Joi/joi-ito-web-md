> [John continues:]*If the request was denied due to the Content Filter configuration* is a sentence fragment, but with *The content category reported is Gen. News.* and *If you feel this site was blocked in error, please contact the Help Desk* the meaning is clear enough. For whatever reason, "General News" is not fit for our troops. I've been meaning to send her a list of links and ask her if she'd be willing to try to access them (Newsweek? New York Times? Common Dreams? Freerepublic.com [a conservative site]? townhall.com [another conservative site]?) I'm also curious what other kinds of sites she can't visit (geek news? music news? yahoo? wikipedia?) and whether she's prohibited from visiting these sites at work because she's /at work/, or if she's encouraged not to pursue the news in general.

[Zaku](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/05/23/rumsfeld_bans_camera_phones_in_iraq.html#n023751), can you or anyone in the military in Iraq corroborate this or look into this?
