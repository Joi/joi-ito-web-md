I'm thinking about getting together with a few bloggers in Stockholm on Sunday. Maybe for lunch, maybe in the afternoon. Please take a look at [the wiki page](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/Stockholm20040612) if you are interested.

Sorry about the short notice.

Update: Meeting at noon on the **13th** at [Kulturhuset](http://www.kulturhuset.stockholm.se/). See you there! (If you're coming, please sign up on the wiki page.)
