[![evablog](http://joi.ito.com/images2/evablog-tm.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/images2/evablog.jpg)  
I'm at Eva Baudet's office right now helping her get [her blog started](http://biaudet.typepad.com/). (She's writing [her first post](http://biaudet.typepad.com/weblog/2004/06/hello.html) now.) She's a member of the Finnish Parliament and a member of the [Swedish People's Party](http://www.sfp.fi/). She's a fellow [GLT](http://glt.typepad.com) and I met her first in Davos. I've been coming to Finland almost every month these days and Eva's been educating me about Finnish and European politics. Finally I get to teach HER something. ;-)

Good luck on your blog Eva, and I hope you can keep it going!
