I'm really sorry. I made a mistake in the date for the meet up in Stockholm. I said the 12th, but I meant the 13th. Can people still meet tomorrow (13) instead of today (12)? Please let me know here or [on the wiki](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/Stockholm20040612). Sorry!!

*If you have already planned to go to Stockholm today, I suggest you drop by the [official bloggers meet up](http://kornet.nu/blindhona/arkiv/000911.html) today...*
