Andrew is trying to draft Bruce Springsteen, an outspoken critic of war, to perform at Giants Stadium (which he has reserved) September 1, the day of the [Republican National Convention](http://www.2004nycgop.org/). Andrew wants you to [sign his petition](http://www.draftbruce.com/).

Bush vs Bruce live would be definitely be something worth watching.
