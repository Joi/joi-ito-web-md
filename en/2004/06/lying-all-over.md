Better late then never. The State Department announced Tuesday that their report that terror has been decreasing was in fact incorrect. Terror actually ROSE in 2003. However, they are still arguing that they are "winning the war on terror." ([AP/NY Times - Amended Report Shows Terror Rose in 2003](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/national/AP-Terror-Report.html))

On our home front, the Japanese diet passed the controversial pension bill ([the pension that 1/3 of the cabinet members have been shown to have evaded at some point](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/05/08/damn_you_japanese_politicians.html)). It is shown that an inflated fertility rate was used for the bill to show rosier numbers and lower, more accurate numbers that had been finalized for more than 2 weeks by the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry were withheld. Public sentiment has already been very negative about the pension system. The government had been pushing this new bill, were paying commissions to retired bureaucrats to collect such pensions from normal citizens, and the politicians themselves not paying. Now this.

Inflated fertility rate used for pension bills](http://www.japantimes.com/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20040623a1.htm))

What surprises me is the stupidity of these lies. Neither of these lies were likely to remain unchallenged. Did these people believe that they could just fudge numbers to make some false short-term point. Amazing.
