In the comments on [an earlier post on this blog about an artist suspected by the FBI of bioterrorism](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/05/27/rtmark_reports_false_arrest_of_artist_by_fbi_who_mistakes_art_for_bioterrorism.html), there was a great deal of speculation about the incident and the facts. (Read the link above to my previous post for the background.) I emailed the artist, Steven Kurtz, asking him for the facts, and here is his reply.

**Deleted by request.**

Many people talked to me about this incident and strongly support the FBI's position on this. I still don't know enough details on the FBI's handling of the matter, but I DO think biotech as art is a legitimate form of art. At Ars Electronica, we did [a whole festival on Life Science as art](http://www.aec.at/lifescience/). Artists, including Steve, publish their works, talk about the impact, and often teach. Terrorists do not.

One famous example of biotech art is the [bioluminescent rabbit](http://www.ekac.org/gfpbunny.html) created by genetic engineering, adding genes from a jellyfish to a rabbit to make it glow in the dark. This created a great deal of controversy and debate. It was the intention of the artist to cause this debate with an extremely tangible project.

I believe this form of expression is important and mistaking artistic expression for something else is a great risk to society. However, I suppose it would be prudent for artists to be aware of the risks involved in handling the "supplies" they use for their art.
