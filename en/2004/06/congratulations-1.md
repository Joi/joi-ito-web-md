Congratulations to Alan Kay for [being awarded the 2004 Kyoto Prize](http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2004/Jun/1047805.htm) in addition to the [ACM Turing Prize](http://www.squeakland.org/images/news/html/turing03.htm) and the [NAE Draper Prize](http://www.hpl.hp.com/news/2004/jan-mar/draper.html) earlier. He's really "cleaning up" this year. This is cool. He deserves it.

Hope this helps the [Squeak](http://www.squeakland.org/index.html) project too!
