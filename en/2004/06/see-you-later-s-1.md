Thanks Maja, Per and Max for your incredible hospitality. Totally amazing visit with the perfect balance of chilling, business and touring around Stockholm and the archipelago.

It was also nice meeting Ludovic, [Erik](http://mymarkup.net/blog), [Dimo](http://angelhill.net/life), Jon, Kim, [David](http://www.fistfulofeuros.net/), and [Roine](http://roines.net/) at [the meetup today](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/Stockholm20040612). (Did I miss anyone?) Thanks for the overview of the Swedish Net community. Look forward to seeing more blogs from Sweden soon!

At the airport on my way back to Helsinki now...
