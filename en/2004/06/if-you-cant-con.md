[A paper](http://www.unc.edu/~cigar/papers/FileSharing_March2004.pdf) by Felix Oberholzer of Harvard Business School and Koleman Strumpf of UNC Chapel Hill shows strong evidence that file-sharing has "statistically indistinguishable from zero" effect on CD sales and the [RIAA decides to sue 482 more people for sharing copyright music on peer-to-peer networks](http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,63945,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_6). This brings the number of people sued by the RIAA for file-sharing to 3,429. I guess that if you can't convince everyone, you can always try to scare people into submission.

But it looks like the RIAA will have event MORE reasons to sue people. They're trying to "[criminalize the act of inducing another to commit a copyright violation](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/001987.shtml)."
