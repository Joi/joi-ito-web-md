On the plane returning from Helsinki to Tokyo, I read an op-ed in the International Herald Tribune, [Dare We Call It Genocide?](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/16/opinion/16KRIS.html?ex=1402718400&en=489e3a074fa589dc&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND) Please click the link and read it. It's short, but an important perspective. People gloss over statistics and even vivid first-hand accounts like this in text often fail to get our attention. In fact, I remember thinking about blogging this article, but it slipped my mind after I returned to Japan.

This morning I saw [Tears of the Sun](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314353/) starring Bruce Willis. This movie is about a heroic extraction mission in Nigeria with ethnic cleansing as a backdrop. The movie itself and its message were not that interesting, but the scene where people are being murdered and raped by soldiers struck me emotionally and created a visual image for me of the atrocities in Sudan. It sparked me to search for and post the link above.

I think it's important to realize that motion pictures and videos have an incredible impact on us emotionally. We've discussed the risks of [racial stereotyping in motion pictures](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/02/15/asianmediawatchnet_mobilizes_against_lost_in_translation.html) and some people have [criticized me for citing shallow movies about important issues](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/02/22/caring_about_the_rest_of_the_world.html). It is clear that movies play a huge role in helping us (accurately or not) [understand and care about cultures](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/01/29/understanding_culture_through_motion_pictures.html).

One thing I've noticed is that amateur films and flash are being used quite effectively in political jokes and commentary on the Net. There are copyright issues with many of the works, but I believe that video blogging, (or whatever you want to call grassroots video production and sharing) can play a very important role in raising awareness on issues such as the genocide in Sudan.

Maybe we need to get [Witness](http://www.witness.org/) and [Passion of the Present](http://passionofthepresent.org/) working together if they aren't already. [Ethan](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/ethan/)?
