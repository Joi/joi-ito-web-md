[![SpiritofAmerica](http://joi.ito.com/images2/SpiritofAmerica.gif)](http://www.spiritofamerica.net/)  
[Spirit of America](http://www.spiritofamerica.net/) is a somewhat grassroots, and quickly growing project to promote humanitarian aid in Iraq. It's interesting to note that both people for and against the war have signed on with their support. [Dan Gillmor says](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/010439.shtml), "Marc Danziger, a.k.a. the '[Armed Liberal](http://windsofchange.net/)' Web logger, supported the war in Iraq. [Britt Blaser](http://www.blaserco.com/blogs/2004/05/31.html), a Howard Dean campaign adviser, did not." Both Marc and Britt are supporting this effort.

Dan also writes, "'It seemed if you could essentially aggregate requests and syndicate those to potential donors, mainly using the Net and electronic outreach, you could respond with speed and on a scale to really make a difference,' Hake said," in an interview with the founder. [Jeff Jarvis says](http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2004_06_01.html#007181), "I have been wanting to bring more citizens' media to Iraq -- blogging tools translated into Arabic and free blog hosting, for example. I now hope we can accomplish this via SoA," which I think is interesting.

I think this is an excellent example of the use of technology and grass roots organization to see if we can do right, something that top-down methods seem to be failing at. It's also an interesting attempt at citizen-to-citizen communications. Lets hope it works better than leader-to-leader communications.
