I'm at [Brainstorm 2004](http://www.fortune.com/fortune/conferences/brainstorm/overview.html) which should be fun. It's my favorite conference of each year. I'm going to be taking notes and will encourage anyone else here wants to use the space to put notes on the [Brainstorms 2004 page](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?Brainstorm%202004) on my new [public SocialText wiki](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi). I'll also be hanging out on #brainstorm on Freenode on IRC.
