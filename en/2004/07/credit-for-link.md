[Dave](http://www.scripting.com/). Thanks for [giving me credit for the Edwards as VP rumor link](http://archive.scripting.com/2004/07/06#When:5:04:49AM). You could have linked directly, credited only [Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/34156) or anything really. Actually, this is something that I struggle with every morning when I open Net News Wire and go through my news feeds. Some people take the position that it's not important where you get the link. I don't think this is true. The dilemma happens when you find links to the same interesting article on several blogs. Do you credit the first link you see? Do you credit the first person who posted it? Do you credit the most authoritative? I notice most people don't usually credit [Blogdex](http://blogdex.net/) or [Daypop](http://www.daypop.com/). You can always go to [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/) and see who first linked to it and who is the most authoritative link.

I don't think we need any global standard for link credits, but it's nice when someone gives it to you and it's something I try to do when I can. So thanks Dave.
