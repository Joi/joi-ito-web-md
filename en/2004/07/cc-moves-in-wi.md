The CC [team](http://creativecommons.org/learn/aboutus/people) at OSAF: Nathan Yergler, Francesca Rodriquez, Mike Linksvayer, Neeru Paharia, Glenn Otis Brown, James Grimmelmann, and Matt Haughey.

[Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org/) has just moved into the [Open Source Application Foundation](http://osafoundation.org/) space in San Francisco. Thanks for [letting our team share the space with you Mitch](http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000678.html). CC and OSAF together does make a lot of sense. I look forward to dropping by soon.
