[Loic blogs about his experience with his customers and the French blogging community](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2004/07/start_a_busines.html). This reminds me of when [I got my bumps from the Japanese diary community](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/11/12/net_culture_sigh.html) about two years ago for trying to push blogging in Japan. We now have a very good relationship with the Japanese Net community, but it took a lot of work on the part of my team and the delivery on a lot of promises.
