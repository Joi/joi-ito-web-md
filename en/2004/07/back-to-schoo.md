I just received word that I have been admitted into the International Business Strategy Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) program at the [Hitotsubashi University Graduate School of International Corporate Strategy](http://www.ics.hit-u.ac.jp/index.php). I was talking to them last year about possibly applying, since the Ministry of Education recently changed the rules so people could apply for a doctorate program without a masters degree. Unfortunately, I don't even have an undergraduate degree so it was tough nuggies for me. They changed the rules this year and let me apply again and I got in. I guess this makes me the least educated student to ever be admitted. hmm...

Anyway, the real reason I'm doing this isn't the degree, although that's nice. It's a very cool program where I will be able to use the resources of the university including research and the professors. My only deliverable is [a book on the sharing economy](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/06/19/describing_the_sharing_economy.html). I don't have to take any classes and the topic really fits right in with [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org/), blogging and everything else I'm doing. I'm a big fan of many of the professors at the school and I am really psyched to be able to exploit them officially now. ;-)

Here is a [PDF of my research topic description](http://joi.ito.com/pdf/joiresearchtopic.pdf).
