[Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/) just acquired [Loic](http://www.loiclemeur.com/)'s blog company, Ublog. Loic had been acting as our marketing partner in Europe, but now he's apart of Six Apart. ([Mena has a good story about this](http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/07/vive_six_apart_1.shtml).)

[Andrew Anker](http://www.kamungus.com/) who I met when he was running Hot Wired back in the day has also just joined Six Apart. (More about that on at [Mena's Corner](http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/07/andrew_at_six_a.shtml))

Last but not least, Barak Berkowitz who was once my boss at Infoseek, then later worked for me at Neoteny, is now taking over the role of CEO of Six Apart. ([Mena's story about this](http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/07/barak_at_six_ap.shtml))

Welcome aboard everyone. I think we're turning a new page in the development of Six Apart. I urge you to read Mena's posts for her view on all of this. I'm a proud VC today.
