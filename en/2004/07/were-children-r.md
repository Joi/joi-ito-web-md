According to this transcript, Hersh says the US government has videotapes of children being raped at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.

They are in total terror it's going to come out... a massive amount of criminal wrongdoing was covered up at the highest command out there, and higher."

> There's also a piece worth reading in this week's *Newsweek* about new allegations of rape and sexual torture at Abu Ghraib. Feature includes details on the identities of the Iraqi prisoners shown in those widely-circulated photographs -- including Satar Jabar (charged with carjacking, not terrorism), whose iconic hooded figure with wires attached is derisively described by many Iraqis as the "Statue of Liberty."

[Ted Turner](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/07/16/brainstorms_2004_dinner_interview_notes_ted_turner.html) also mentioned something about sodomy at Abu Ghraib last night, I think. I wonder if this is what he was talking about.
