[Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/)'s new project, [ChangeThis](http://www.changethis.com/) is a project to have interesting people write short "manifestos". Seth's working on creating a new form of literature. It's looks like something between a paper, a blog post and a marketing presentation with a message. It will be interesting to see how this takes off. It looks interesting to me. They have a blog, "[Read and Pass](http://blog.changethis.com/readandpass/)".
