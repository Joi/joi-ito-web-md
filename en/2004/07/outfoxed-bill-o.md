> This video commercial starts out with a quote from talk show host Bill O'Reilly making the claim that he has told a guest to "shut up" only one time in six years. The rest of the commercial shows clips of Mr. O'Reilly telling people to shut up.

This looks like a partial trailer or something for [OutFoxed](http://www.outfoxed.org/) that [Larry Lessig's been blogging about](http://www.lessig.org/blog/). I just [ordered it on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002HDXTQ/chanponorg). [Jon Lebkowsky talks about his experience watching it with friends](http://www.weblogsky.com/archives/000165.html).
