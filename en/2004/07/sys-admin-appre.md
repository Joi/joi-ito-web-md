Although the day has past in Japan, it is [Sys Admin Appreciation Day](http://www.sysadminday.com/) in the US. System administrators are some of the most important and often least appreciated members of the team and this is a great opportunity to thank them.

I'd like to thank Kuri who does the brunt of my network admin, [Boris](http://bopuc.levendis.com/weblog/) who does most of my blog admin and pixel pushing, and [Adriaan](http://www.kung-foo.tv/) and [Jim](http://www.wirefarm.com/) who help out when they can. Special thanks to [Justin](http://www.links.net/), for installing my first [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) installation.

Thanks to [Peter](http://peterkaminski.com/), [Adina](http://alevin.com/weblog/) and [Ed](http://vielmetti.typepad.com/) for helping me out on my SocialText stuff, to everyone on [#joiito](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel) for keeping the bots running. Although they're not really Sys Admins, to [Jeannie](http://jeanniecool.blogspot.com/) and [Suw](http://chocnvodka.blogware.com/blog) for being the "[strange attractors](http://www.corante.com/strange/)" on #joiito who keep it going.

I'd like to thank the team who started Eccosys: [Cyrus](http://www.tomigaia.com/about.cyrus.shtml), Sen, Shimokawa, Daishi and Jona, and kudos also to Ushioda who pitched in at Neoteny.

Thanks also to Scott Burns who kept [The Meta Network](http://www.tmn.com/) running for all those years.

Finally, I'd like to thank all of the people who run the dns and other vital components of the Internet and keep it working.

The world would not work without you all.

(I'm sorry if I missed anyone.)
