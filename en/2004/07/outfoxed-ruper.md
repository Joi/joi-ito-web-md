[Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism](http://www.outfoxed.org/). An amazing documentary about Fox News and the danger of corporations controlling news. There is a [QT](http://http.dvlabs.com/carolina/Outfxd2/Trailer_A(Med).mov) and a [Windows Media](http://http.dvlabs.com/carolina/Outfxd2/Trailer_A(WM7).wmv) trailer online. There is a [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/11/magazine/11FOX.html?ex=1247284800&en=9d0fa030408198b9&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland) about producer [Robert Greenwald](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0339254/)'s unique method of distributing the documentary, selling the DVD for distribution through political action groups.

> As the Times article describes, Greenwald’s style for distributing documentaries may be the beginning of something new — political criticism, using interviews and clips, making a strong political point, distributed through DVDs and political action groups. (See some other examples [here](http://www.outfoxed.org/Recommendations.php?#UN)). On what theory does he, and others, have the right to use such material without permission? On the [free culture](http://freeculture.org/) theory we call the First Amendment: Copyright law must, the Court told us in Eldred, embed “fair use”; “fair use” is informed by First Amendment values; the values of the First Amendment most relevant here are those expressed in [New York Times v. Sullivan](http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=376&invol=254). As with news-gathering, critical political filmmaking needs a buffer zone of protection against the overreaching of the law. And if the potential of this medium — now liberated by digital technology — is to be realized, we need clear precedents that establish that critics have the freedom to criticize without having to hire a lawyer first.
