Mark Pilgrim's [Dive Into Python](http://www.diveintopython.org/) is now available as [a printed book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590593561/chanponorg). This is the best tutorial for my favorite programming language. I [wrote more about the book](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/09/17/dive_into_python_the_book.html) when Mark announced it back in September of last year.
