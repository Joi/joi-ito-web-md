> Stanford Magazine carries [a story this month](http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2004/julaug/farm/news/lessig.html) about our chairman and co-founder [Lawrence Lessig](http://www.lessig.org/)'s book which has just entered its third printing. This is interesting because the book is [freely available online for download](http://www.free-culture.cc/freecontent/) (under a Creative Commons license), and has been downloaded about 180,000 times. On the one hand an author can give away free content for folks to [remake into audio books, translations, and other formats](http://www.free-culture.cc/remixes/), **and** the author still gets paid through traditional book sales. Amazing how that works, and works so well sometimes. [via [Copyfight](http://www.corante.com/copyfight/)]

It will be very difficult to "prove" that the Creative Common license and the freely downloadable aspect of *Free Culture* improved sales, but the book is selling and making it freely available has clearly not STOPPED sales. I wonder if it is possible to show that making books available for free electronically increases the sale of real books? I wonder if there are particular genres where this holds more true...
