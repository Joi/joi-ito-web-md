Thanks to [Adriaan](http://www.kung-foo.tv/), Jace, [Boris](http://bopuc.levendis.com/weblog/) and Kuri for updating Joi Ito's Web to Movable Type 3 and moving it to [Bloghosts](http://bloghosts.com/), the new home for Joi Ito's Web. The load time seems about the same, but the rebuild time on the new servers seems much faster so I think trackbacks and comments should not be a problem anymore. Let me know what you think.

Also, I don't have the birthday script and other things running yet, but hope to get it going soon. We switched to [Adriaan's Technorati MT plugin](http://blog.kung-foo.tv/archives/000790.php) and are making some other changes. Boris is doing some design changes too as you can see.
