I was chatting with [AKMA](http://akma.disseminary.org/) the other day about my thumb. He's had [thumb problems](http://akma.disseminary.org/archives/000476.html), and my thumb hurts. Ever since he got his hernia operation and my [post about his Hernia](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/10/02/akmas_hernia_operation.html) operation became the top result on [Google for a search of hernia operation](http://www.google.com/search?q=hernia+operation), we've had this mutual medical support bond. (It's not #1 now, but still on the top page.)

Anyway, we were talking about thumbs, and that reminded me about [Even Cowgirls Get the Blues by Tom Robbins](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/055334949X/chanponorg/102-4118217-0508911). Then I remembered that I liked [Jitterbug Perfume](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553348981/chanponorg/102-4118217-0508911) better. AKMA said that he didn't have enough silliness in his life. (I can't really image that is true, but if a Reverend says he needs more silliness, it must be serious.) So I decided to send him the two books. Although I didn't remember the stories very clearly, I clearly remember they were both very silly and fun.

I had forgotten that Jitterbug Perfume and probably Tom Robbins in general tended to be a bit snarky about Christianity. I'd never read them from the perspective of a Reverend before. [AKMA seems to have taken it in stride](http://akma.disseminary.org/archives/001436.html), but it's interesting how you can overlook things that suddenly become snarky in context. I feel like someone who had been laughing at a joke that isn't very funny for some of my friends.

This stream of consciousness [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/) impulse buy story was very helpful during my NPR reading series interview when they asked if I ever ready any fiction.
