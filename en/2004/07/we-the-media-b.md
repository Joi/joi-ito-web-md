![wtmcover](http://joi.ito.com/images/wtmcover.jpg)Noticed  [a beta version of a blog](http://wethemedia.oreilly.com/) for [Dan Gillmor](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/)'s new book *[We the Media](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/wemedia/)* in my [Technorati cosmos](http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&url=joi.ito.com&sub=Go%21). ;-)

I am expecting this blog to be required reading in the same way [Smart Mobs](http://www.smartmobs.com/index.html) has become for me. I think this idea of having blogs to keep the ball rolling after publishing a book is a great idea.
