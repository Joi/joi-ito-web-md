I just found this very funny [clip](http://www.overspun.com/video/AmericasYouth.rm) from David Letterman on [David Weinberger's blog](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002819.html). (You need Real Player) So David, you may be the last person in America to see this clip, but at least not the last in the world. It's very funny. It's like a new twist to [Stealth Disco](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/10/06/stealth_discoed_by_halley.html).
