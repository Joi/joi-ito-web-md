I just got email from an old friend who told me that one of my old friends who I haven't seen for years, Genesis P-Orridge has breasts now. There is a [picture of him and his breasts](http://genesisp-orridge.com/files/2003/10/28/20/13/44/gen_on_red_chair1_copy.jpg) on [his site](http://www.genesisp-orridge.com/), which turns out to be a blog. Yay!

I first saw Genesis probably about 15 years ago when he came to Japan and performed a penis piercing on stage at at event that was sponsored by Sony, Silicon Graphics and a bunch of other big name companies. It was produced by Professor Mitsuhiro Takemura. Japanese companies sponsored a lot of sub-culture stuff back then...

I first actually talked to Genesis when I interviewed him for a Japanese magazine and he was in Japan for a Psychic TV concert. Later, we became friends. I remember going to stay at his house and thinking, as I slept on his sofa, that the sound of the dozens of the body piercings jangling as he walked around the house naked sounded a skeleton with chains in some movie or something.

Looking at his blog, I'm glad to see that it looks like he's doing well. I also just noticed that [he looks](http://genesisp-orridge.com/files/2003/08/24/14/38/44/gen_castle.jpg) a lot like [Kiefer Sutherland](http://www.24-italia.it/foto/kiefer-jack/Normal%20Version/Kiefer%2036.jpg). (I'm watching [24](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285331/) right now.)

Anyway, if you see this, "Hi Gen!"
