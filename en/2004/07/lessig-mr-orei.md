Lessig writes an open letter to Bill O'Reilly from the FOX News show The Factor. Lessig has been [blogging a lot about](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/002018.shtml) [OutFoxed](http://www.outfoxed.org/), [Richard Greenwald](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0339254/)'s film criticizing FOX News. Lessig links to a clip from the film, the original interview with Jeremy Glick and the offending anti-war ad. He takes on point by point the series of false accusations that O'Reilly has been making about Glick in an unfair smear campaign against his Glick.

Mr. O'Reilly,

You have declared a "war" on the New York Times. That's good for you, good for them, and good for our democracy: Strong opinions deserve strong spokesmen. Your battle will help sharpen a debate about matters important to the Republic.

But in waging this "war," you are continuing to abuse a man whom you have wronged, and to whom you owe an apology.

On February 4, 2003, Jeremy Glick was your guest on THE FACTOR. Glick had lost his father in the attack of 9/11. He had also signed an ad criticizing the war in Iraq. You were "surprised" that one who had lost his father could oppose that war. And so you had him on your show, presumably to ask him why. (Here's a [clip](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/OReillyGlick.mov) from [Outfoxed](http://outfoxed.org) putting this story together.)

You might not remember precisely what you said on that interview, or more importantly, what Jeremy Glick said. So here's a [copy](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/glick_interview.mov) that you can watch. Nor may you remember precisely what the ad that Jeremy Glick signed said. Here's a [copy](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/nion_NYT9-19.pdf) that you can read. And when you've watched what was actually said, and read what was actually written, I'm sure you will see that the statements you continue to make about Jeremy Glick are just plain false. Not Bill Clinton "depends upon what is is" false, but false the way most Americans learned growing up: just not true. Please read [Lessig's entire post](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/002046.shtml).
