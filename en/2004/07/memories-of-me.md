[I saw this picture on Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/07/30/ancient_harddrive_gu.html). It's a ancient (about 30 years old) hard disk that probably fit about 256K according to a Boing Boing reader.

This [iDuck](http://www.dynamism.com/iduck/) can hold 1000X as much as that disk drive.

And these little [0.2mm RFID chips](http://joi.ito.com/moblog/entries/2003/06/10/002103.html) hold 128K each.

I wonder when they will start selling memory at the drug store in Petabytes per gram...
