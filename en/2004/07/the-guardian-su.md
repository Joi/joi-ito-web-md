> New research suggesting that file sharing has no impact upon sales of CDs has, not surprisingly, angered the music industry. [our very own] [Suw Charman](http://chocnvodka.blogware.com/blog) reports

Suw has a good article in the Guardian about [the paper (PDF)](http://www.unc.edu/~cigar/papers/FileSharing_March2004.pdf) by Associate Professor Felix Oberholzer-Gee of Harvard Business School in Boston and Professor Koleman Strumpf of the University of North Carolina where they assert that "Downloads have an effect on sales which is statistically indistinguishable from zero, despite rather precise estimates." It's an important first paper in the battle against the rampant idea that file sharing is destroying the music business and Suw does a good job introducing it and additional ideas to public in a more popular medium. Yay!
