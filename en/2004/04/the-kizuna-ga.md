I am hosting a gathering here in Tokyo starting tomorrow. It's a somewhat academic meeting to talk about social science issues and technological issues around mobility and microcontent. Participants include a small group of academics, technologists and business people. I'll let you know if we come up with anything interesting. Some of the other participants will probably be blogging as well.

This is the first time that I've ever worked together with [my sister](http://itofisher.com/mito/) to organize something so that's been fun. It's also been great working with the team at the [Insight & Foresight unit at Nokia](http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,5498,00.html) who are supporting the event. BTW, "Kizuna" is a Japanese word that means a kind of mental linkage between people. "Friendship" and "family tie" are probably close counterparts in English.
