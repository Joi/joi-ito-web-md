Somewhat scary, but pretty interesting [Orkut](http://www.orkut.com/) datamining. [An Orkut density map](http://www.datawhorehouse.com/orkut/) and a [Orkut Personal Network GeoMapper](http://www.datawhorehouse.com/orkut/mapme.php). [Here's a map of my network](http://www.datawhorehouse.com/orkut/mapme.php?id=1405190888294923508&nl=1&browse=1&ms=&nb=). It doesn't seem to map my complete network. It's also too bad it's not global yet.
