The Japanese "sort of equivalent" of [SuicideGirls](http://suicidegirls.com/) is [Cure](http://www.mycure.net/), a [cosplay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosplay) sight. The biggest difference is that the sexy pictures are not allowed. It's quite an amazing community. There are 5000 *layers* (comes from Cosplayers) and 30,000 *cameko* (comes from *camera kozo* or "Camera Boys"). The layers can be sorted by ranking or by the characters they play. The cameko are otaku who spend their lives taking pictures of the layers and giving beautiful prints of their photos to the layers and sharing them online. The site lets you send these photos to or view them on your mobile phones.
