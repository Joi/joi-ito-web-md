Everyone makes fun of the Japanese use of English. (See [Engrish](http://www.engrish.com/)) [The Chicago Tribune has a story](http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/chi-040406tattoos-photogallery,1,6344756.photogallery?coll=chi-homepagenews2-utl&index=1) featuring Chicagoans with tattoos Japanese characters and a comparison of what the bearers think they mean and what they really mean in Japanese. Very funny.
