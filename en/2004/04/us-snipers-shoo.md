[Story about US snipers shooting kids and pinning down the ambulance and evacuation services in Falluja](http://www.wildfirejo.org.uk/feature/display/114/index.php). Here's a [photo of a dead baby on Al Jazeera](http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/8CB7C17E-F69E-48A2-8034-DEA425192815.htm). Is there any coverage of this in other media?
