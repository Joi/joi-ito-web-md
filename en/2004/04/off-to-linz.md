I'm at Narita airport on my way to Linz to be on the [Digital Communities jury of Ars Electronica](http://www.aec.at/en/prix/communities/communities.asp). I think this is my eighth year as a jury member for Ars Electronica so going to Linz feels like going back to an old home. I look forward to eating my favorite wienerschnitzel soon.
