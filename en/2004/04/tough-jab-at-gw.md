> Via [Wonkette](http://www.wonkette.com/), here's a slightly unfair but powerful [rejoinder to President Bush's jokes](http://www.musicforamerica.org/bushjoke) about weapons of mass destruction. Media is in the hands of everyone, and people are going to use it to hold powerful people -- including media people, such as the Washington correspondents who found Bush's performance so hilarious -- to account.

People seem to really be embracing web video as a medium and it definitely delivers the message at a different level than text. Very interesting to see how this form develops.
