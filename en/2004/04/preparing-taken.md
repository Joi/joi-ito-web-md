*Takenoko* are bamboo shoots. We're in *takenoko* season right now. You take a special hoe and walk around in a bamboo forest until you step on the tip of the *takenoko*. The best and most tender *takenoko* are the ones that are barely visible. As they grow larger, they become tougher. You have to then dig around the *takenoko*, find where it attaches to the root network and chop it at the right angle to get it to come off easily. Then you shuck them. After shucking, a very important step is the *aku nuki*. Many vegetables, particularly *takenoko* have a very bitter taste that comes from [impurities (alkaline solution and dissolved elements)](http://www.awagami.com/glossary.html) which is called *aku*. *Aku nuki* (removing the aku) is typically done stewing the *takenoko* with *komenuka* (rice husk powder) and Japanese red chili peppers. The best *takenoko* is tender *takenoko* picked and immediately stewed, left over night in the water, then prepared with rice, stew or some other typical Japanese dish in the morning. Yum.
