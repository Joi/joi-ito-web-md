There's [a short interview in MIT's The Tech newpaper with Jack Valenti about DMCA](http://www-tech.mit.edu/V124/N20/ValentiIntervie.20f.html). I'm glad that Jack is still willing to have discussions like this. This is what I meant when I said that I think [Jack should be respected](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/03/29/valenti_right_and_wrong_is_a_man_to_respect.html). Even if you don't agree with him, he's still willing to try to discuss his position with you.
