Jibot is the robot who lives in the [#joiito channel](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel). He was originally developed by [rvr](http://rvr.typepad.com/) and became a group effort. With everyone hacking on him, he had gotten a bit flakey. [termie with the help of a few others totally refactored him](http://anarkystic.com/blog/archives/000012.php) and now jibot is really happy. Thank you termie!

Jibot has a [wiki page](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/JiBot), [a blog](http://hashjoiito.bloxus.com/) and a [sourceforge page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jibot/) for the code.
