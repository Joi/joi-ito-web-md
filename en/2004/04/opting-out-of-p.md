Apologies to friends who use Plaxo, but I'm [opting out of Plaxo](https://www.plaxo.com/opt_out) since it has become a source of spam for me and I feel like I'm doing all the work. Anyone who wants to find my contact info can just Google me or find it on [my wiki page](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/JoiIto).
