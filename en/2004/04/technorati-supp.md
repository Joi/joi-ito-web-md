You can now track who is linking to particular posts on my blog by clicking the Technorati link next to link next to trackbacks at the bottom of the post. The result is similar to [trackbacks](http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/), but these links are links that have been discovered by [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/), whereas trackbacks are links that are sent to me directly by other bloggers. [Boing Boing recently started Technorati support](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/04/12/boing_boing_add_tech.html) and [Dave Sifry explains how to add this to your blog](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000345.html). Since I don't get as many links as Boing Boing, clicking the Technorati link will often yield no results. I think we need to figure out a way to easily show how many links from Technorati, just like comments and trackbacks so people will know whether they should click or not. [Adriaan's got it running on his blog](http://www.kung-foo.tv/blog/archives/000790.php) using the Technorati API, but it's a bit dodgy still so I'm going to wait for a better solution. ;-)

In order to make these results more accurate, it would be great if people made a point to link as much as possible to the permalinks rather than the top level URL when referring to entries in blogs.
