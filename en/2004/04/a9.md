I've been messing around with [A9](http://a9.com/), Amazon's search engine project. It integrates search inside the book, [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/) and the recommendation engine on Amazon so you can find web pages and Amazon will recommend other sites that you might like. Considering how "meta data savvy" Amazon is and how easily they can connect search to their core business, I can see A9 giving Google a pretty good run for their money.

[Here's the "joi.ito.com" on Amazon.](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000CBS5L/002-2252167-2895213?url=joi.ito.com/) I'm not sure whether I like the fact that they list my address and phone number. Also, I find the data on Alexa a bit sketchy. The traffic chart for my site is very noisy and doesn't track my actual traffic logs and it says my site is "very slow". (It isn't THAT slow is it?) I hope that Alexa gets better now that it's integrated into Amazon. [On more famous sites like Boing Boing, they have ratings and reviews.](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00006BU32/002-2252167-2895213?v=glance&url=boingboing.net/)

[Christian Lindholm has some good thoughts on A9 on his blog.](http://www.christianlindholm.com/christianlindholm/2004/04/search_turned_f.html)
