I've been getting a lot of SNAM (Social Network Spam) so I'm happy to hear that [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com) has a new flag that you can set that prevents you from receiving invitation from people who are not in your address book. It's a bit snobbly, but it prevents you from having to turn down invitation requests from people you don't know. On LinkedIn, I generally don't accept invitations from people I don't know because the purpose of the network is to refer people to each other and you can't really write a reference for someone you don't know. Although this probably lowers the "virality", I think this feature will enhance my LinkedIn experience and hats off to Reid for implementing it.

For people who are on LinkedIn, here's [the URL](https://www.linkedin.com/contactSettings?displayConnectionSettings=&trk=tab_) to set the flag. If you haven't uploaded your address book, this will effectively make it impossible for people to invite you though.
