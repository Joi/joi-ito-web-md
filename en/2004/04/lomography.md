I recently discovered [lomography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lomography). I think it fits very naturally with the spirit of [moblogging](http://joi.ito.com/moblog2/).

> The 10 Golden Rules of Lomography

1 - take your camera everywhere you go  
2 - use it any time - day and night  
3 - lomography is not an interference in your life, but a part of it  
4 - try the shot from the hip  
5 - approach the objects of your lomographic desire as close as possible  
6 - don't think (Wiliam Firebrace)  
7 - be fast  
8 - you don't have to know beforehand what you capture on film  
9 - afterwards either  
10 - don't worry about the rules
