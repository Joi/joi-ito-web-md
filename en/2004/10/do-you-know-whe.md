People have been reporting about the FBI ordering a hosting provider, Rackspace, with offices in the US and the UK to seize at least two servers from Indymedia's UK datacenter. Indymedia is a well known edgy alternative news site which was established to provide grassroots coverage of the WTO protests in Seattle. It has grown into a multinational resource for some hardcore journalism including a lot of work on the Diebold and the Patroit Act issues. The reports as well as [Indymedia's page on this story](http://indymedia.org/en/static/fbi) say that the FBI has not provided a reason for the seizure to Indymedia. The statement from Rackspace says:
> Rackspace
>
> In the present matter regarding Indymedia, Rackspace Managed Hosting, a U.S. based company with offices in London, is acting in compliance with a court order pursuant to a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT), which establishes procedures for countries to assist each other in investigations such as international terrorism, kidnapping and money laundering. Rackspace responded to a Commissioner’s subpoena, duly issued under Title 28, United States Code, Section 1782 in an investigation that did not arise in the United States. Rackspace is acting as a good corporate citizen and is cooperating with international law enforcement authorities. The court prohibits Rackspace from commenting further on this matter.

In past, Indymedia has done stuff like [posting photos of undercover police officers](http://estrecho.indymedia.org/newswire/display/10418/index.php). However, according to Indymedia, the "FBI asked for the Nantes post on swiss police to be removed, but admitted no laws were violated". This time the FBI has not told them what they've done wrong and Rackspace is under a gag order so they can't even tell Indymedia exactly what hardware they removed.

This implies that some non-US entity had the FBI force an action in the UK under MLAT. This means that Indymedia is being suspected of engaging in international terrorism, kidnapping or money laundering. I've seen some extreme reporting on Indymedia, but terrorism, kidnapping or money laundering? I guess the definition of "terrorism" has been expanded to meet popular demand these days, but come on... really?

This reminds me of [toywar](http://toywar.etoy.com/). A group of Swiss artists established in 1994 who are Golden Nica award winners from my Ars Electronica jury in 1996 call themselves [etoy](http://www.etoy.com/). Later, [Etoys](http://www.etoys.com/), founded in 1998 tried to take the etoy.com domain by force. They got a temporary injunction against the web site because a judge in LA agreed that it was confusing to customers of Etoys. [Network Soutions complied and went beyond their call of duty and shut down etoy.com email as well for good measure](http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,33111,00.html). Swiss artists can be sued in a US court and having their email shut down by a US registrar.

My point is, be careful where your data lives...

UPDATE: [nyc.indymedia.org is speculating](http://nyc.indymedia.org/feature/display/126066/index.php) that it is because Indymedia published the identities of the RNC delegates.

UPDATE2: It appears that maybe it wasn't the RNC, but the photos of the police officers [according to Cryptome](http://cryptome.org/fbi-imc/fbi-imc-doc.htm).

UPDATE3: [imajes has an written a letter to his MPs](http://imajes.info/archives/2004/10/11/indymedia). Maybe others should do the same.
