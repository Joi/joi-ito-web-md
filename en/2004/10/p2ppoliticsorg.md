[p2p-Politics.org](http://p2p-politics.org/) is a cool new site that lists video ads supporting Kerry, Bush and Nader. Although the site was launched by known Kerry supporters and currently there are only ads from the [Kerry campaign](http://www.johnkerry.com/) and some of [MoveOn.org](http://www.moveon.org/)'s [Bush in 30 Seconds](http://bushin30seconds.org/) ads, there is a tab for Bush and Nader and are soliciting ads from them. They also ask people to [submit their own ads](http://p2p-politics.org/contribute). The idea is that the site would be a non-partisan site that allows you to view ads of the candidates and email links to the ads to friends. The ads are hosted by the [Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org/) and licensed under a [Creative Commons license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/). The "p2p" here stands for people-to-people or peer-to-peer but is not p2p as in the file sharing protocol. This site is a volunteer effort by [J Christopher Garcia](http://jx-opher.com/) and [Aaron Swartz](http://aaronsw.com/), "with some ideas by [Lawrence Lessig](http://lessig.org/blog)" and support from [the Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org/).
