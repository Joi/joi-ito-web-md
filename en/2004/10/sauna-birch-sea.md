Just went with Marko and a bunch of friends (including [Loic](http://www.loiclemeur.com/) and [Heiko](http://www.hebig.com/)) to the [Finnish Sauna Society](http://www.sauna.fi/pages/saunasoc.htm). The sea wasn't frozen yet, so it wasn't [avantouinti](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/02/28/avantouinti.html), but the ocean was 8 degrees celsius so it was plenty cold. Did the sauna, whip each other with birch branches and swim in the ocean routing five times. Then we sat around the fire cooking sausages. Very relaxing and a nice unwind after the Italian anarchy. ;-) Now I'm ready to spend the day tomorrow in a conference room with the Finns.
