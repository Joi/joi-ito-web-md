The day before yesterday, I received a notice from my hosting service that I was 80% through my bandwidth limit. I replied and asked for m.m.m.more bandwidth please. Then suddenly, I was at 100% and some trigger kicked in and shut down my site. It appears to have been a flood of requests from a singe IP address. (Who would want to DoS my blog...?)

[Bloghosts](http://www.bloghosts.com/) has been generous on their pricing and Jace who runs it has generally been fairly responsive. For some reason, I haven't been able to get any response from anyone from Bloghosts. It is very unlike Jace so I'm going to hold back my criticism until I have more facts. It could be that there is some reasonable explanation.

Anyway, thank you for the flood of emails letting me know my site was down. I'm so glad you all care. (sniff) But the real thanks goes to [Jason](http://jason.defillippo.com/blog/) who set me up with space on his machine (where are you are reading this now) and [Adriaan](http://www.kung-foo.tv/) for getting my blog moved over to the new machine after a 24 hour outage. Since Jason doesn't seem to mind, I think I'll hang out on this server for awhile... so move over and give me some more room [Sean](http://www.seanbonner.com/), [Chey](http://www.gnome-girl.com/) and [Gary](http://weblog.garyturner.net/).
