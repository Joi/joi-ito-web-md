I mirrored the [the movie](http://joi.ito.com/movies/gopconstrm.mov) in case the source above gets overloaded.

Apologies to my Republican readers, but although [I already declared that I'm a partisan blogger](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/04/27/partisan_blogging.html), I'm going to start leaning into it a bit harder as you can see from my recent posts. Since I can't vote, it's the least I can do. Feel free to comment though. ;-)
