Speaking of unreachable sites... [George Bush's official site](http://www.georgewbush.com/) used to time out when you tried to access it from Japan, Australia, New Zealand and a few other places I think. [I blogged this back in August.](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/08/28/japan_blocked_from_george_w_bush_site.html) Now it tells you formally:  
> www.georgewbush.com
>
> **Access Denied**

You don't have permission to access "http://www.georgewbush.com/" on this server.Much more formal than just timing out on us. But it's more clear now that it is intentional. Why would the Bush campaign want to block access from Japan?
