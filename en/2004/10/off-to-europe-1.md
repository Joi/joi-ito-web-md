I'm leaving today for Rome, Milan, Helsinki then London. 24 degrees C in Rome, 0 degrees C in Helsinki. Hmm...

As usual, [my schedule is on my wiki](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/?joi_s_travel).

UPDATE: Note to self. Try not to travel the day after a typhoon> If you have to, arrive VERY early. Luckily I arrived unusually early. The airport is hell. Piles of sleeping bags and cranky people who spent the night at the airport. Two hours to get to the check-in counter. Took me 4 hours to get to the gate. Ugh.
