Reasons cited are music users' increased consciousness about copyrights and maintenance of legality (conformity to the CD-audio format specification). In related news, Sony also released [a slightly updated HD walkman](http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/av/docs/20040929/sony.htm) ([translation](http://www.excite.co.jp/world/english/web/body/?wb_url=http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/av/docs/20040929/sony.htm&wb_lp=JAEN&wb_dis=2&wb_co=excitejapan)) due to pressure from the iPod, but because of hardware limitations the device still does not support MP3 playback."

Yay! Sony does something smart in the DRM space for a change.
