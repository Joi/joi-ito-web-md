It seems like we're having a typhoon almost ever week. This one isn't supposed to be as bad as [the last one](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/10/09/direct_hit_coming_from_super_typhoon_maon.html), but all flights at Haneda Airport in Tokyo have just been grounded.

UPDATE: [TSR says](http://forecast.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/shadow/tracker/dynamic/200427W.html) it's just a tropical storm, but it feels stronger than the other one. It's supposed to hit early in the morning...

UPDATE: 17 dead, 19 missing and 207 injured as of 10PM (1 hr 40 min ago). 187,000 homes evacuated. This one seems to be worse than the last one. It should hit our town in about 30 minutes. Doesn't seem so bad yet, but should probably shut down desktop computers...

UPDATE: Now 22 dead, 30 missing. The typhoon veered NorthWest and missed our region.
