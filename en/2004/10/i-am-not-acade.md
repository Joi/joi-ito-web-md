I just got my student ID which lets me into the library. I can now finally look up citations that the academics throw at me. But more importantly... I have access to [Lexis-Nexis](http://www.lexisnexis.com/). w00t!!

It's a weird feeling. I feel like I'm sitting behind some massive intellectual firewall. I can research all kinds of stuff here, but many of the sources are not online and do not have permalinks. I can blog about them, but many times all I will be able to provide is the "nah nah, I bet your library doesn't have THIS periodical" sort of citation. On the other hand, I guess part of my new job here is to get some of the knowledge out of this institution and into the public...
