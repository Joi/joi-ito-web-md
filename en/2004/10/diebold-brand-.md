> **The Scene:** Carnegie Mellon University
>
> **The Event:** A newly installed [Diebold Opteva 520 ATM](http://www.diebold.com/solutions/atms/opteva/default.htm) crashes, then reboots. Suprizingly, it's vanilla-style Windows XP operating system initialized without the actual ATM software.
>
> **The Result:** A desktop computer with only a touch screen interface is left wide open for the amusement of the most wired university in the U.S.

Take a look at the site for details, but you can imagine how much fun they had. The picture above is Windows Media Player running on the ATM. As they point out, the scary thing is that Diebold are also making the voting machines.
