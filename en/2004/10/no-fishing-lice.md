> This just in: the Supreme Court has [denied cert](http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/101204.ZOR.html) in [RIAA v. Verizon](http://www.eff.org/legal/cases/RIAA_v_Verizon/), the case in which the recording industry initially won the right to unmask an anonymous KaZaA user with a special non-judicial, PATRIOT Act-like [subpoena](http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca-sub/) under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The DC Circuit [reversed](http://www.eff.org/legal/cases/RIAA_v_Verizon/opinion-20031219.pdf) (PDF) that ruling, but the [RIAA](http://www.riaa.org) appealed. Now the Supreme Court has declined to hear the case.

I love it when the good guys win. Congratulations EFF!
