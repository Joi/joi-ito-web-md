Ellen Simonetti, who writes [the Diary of Flight Attendant](http://queenofsky.journalspace.com/), has been fired [(BBC article)](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3955913.stm) by [Delta Airlines](http://www.delta.com/) because she posted pictures of herself in uniform. Maybe a blog to protect the rights of fired bloggers should be launched ?

There is guidance which suggests the company uniform cannot be used without approval from management, but use in personal pictures on websites is unclear.I think this is a stupid decision on the part of Delta Airlines. If they didn't have a policy and didn't like it, they should have told her to take it down, not suspend her. What they should have done is not cared. I'm sure her blog would INCREASE the number of Delta Airline flyers, not decrease them. I for one now have a lower image of Delta.

UPDATE: She was not "fired". She was "suspended without pay".
