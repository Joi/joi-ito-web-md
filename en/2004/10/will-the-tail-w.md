So the big question for me after reading Chris Anderson's excellent article, [The Long Tail](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html) is... Will there always be producers and consumers of music and other content, or does the amateur revolution really take off and completely blur the consumer and the producer of content? Will amateur and nearly free [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org/) style content become the primary content that people consume? Will most consumers create content as well? In other words, will the long tail wag? I've heard many theories about this and it is probably different for text, audio, photos and video, but I think this is an important question.

And in case you haven't noticed, it's clearly now a discovery problem, not a delivery problem.
