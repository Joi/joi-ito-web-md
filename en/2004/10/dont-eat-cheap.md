Gen says, "[Don't eat cheap sushi](http://www.kanai.net/weblog/archives/002399.html)". I agree. I had never heard about the [carbon monoxide process](http://www.goupstate.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041006/ZNYT04/410060398/1051/news01) before, but it make me not want to eat cheap sushi even more. On the other hand, I guess some places could start raising prices and still serve crap.
