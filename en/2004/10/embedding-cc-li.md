One of the difficulties with [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org/) licenses for music and images is that the images and the music are often copied or forwarded without the licenses. By embedding the license information inside of the mp3 or jpeg data itself, it makes it easier to keep the license attached to the file.

 [Nathan has just released](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4476) a nice drag and drop embedded license lookup tool. See [the page about metadata embedding](http://creativecommons.org/technology/embedding) on the CC site for more information on our thoughts on this issue.
