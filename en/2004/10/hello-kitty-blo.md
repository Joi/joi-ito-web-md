[Hello Kitty has a blog](http://diary.hellokitty.ne.jp/). It looks like she's been blogging since July. Unfortunately, it's in Japanese. [The press release](http://japan.cnet.com/news/media/story/0,2000047715,20070156,00.htm) says that it is a joint project between Sanrio and NTT Data, but according to the blog, Hello Kitty is writing it herself. She asserts that this moblog picture was taken herself. Maybe that's why she's a bit out of focus. She should have had someone take the picture for her. Anyway, welcome to Blogging Kitty-chan.
