Craig of [Craig's list](http://www.craigslist.org/) [says](http://www.cnewmark.com/archives/000293.html): "now The Daily Show is my most trusted source of news." It maybe tongue-in-cheek but it's not far from the truth.

The amazing thing is, the only reason I am able to watch it at all is because of P2P filesharing / Bittorrent. I think file sharing of videos is a key component of freedom of speech and public discourse when so much attention is focused on television. Although we can dance around singing "fair use", is there any chance news programs can make their content available via Creative Commons for people to share so those of us not in America and have better access to your "public discourse"?
