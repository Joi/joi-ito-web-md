[Liz](http://mamamusings.net/) has announced her new [Lab for Social Computing](http://social.it.rit.edu/) at RIT over on [Many-2-Many](http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/12/20/new_lab_for_social_computing_at_rit.php). I'm excited to be on [the advisory board](http://social.it.rit.edu/people/advisory_board/) and look forward to seeing some great work from lab.
