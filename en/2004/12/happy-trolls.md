Hugh has a [great post about "The Happy Troll".](http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/001172.html) I've been thinking about this recently as well and I think he hits the nail on the head. This blog is my living room and if you can't behave, I'll ban you. It's not about censorship. I just don't have time to deal with all of the "Happy Trolls". Maybe I should put together a new comment policy that deals with the notion of "The Happy Troll."
