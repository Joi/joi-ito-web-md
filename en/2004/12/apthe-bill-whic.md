I wonder what they're going to do about [mobloggin' Aibos](http://pt.textamerica.com/?r=407974)...

On a more serious note, although "it carves out exceptions for law enforcement, intelligence and prison work," what does this mean exactly? How about private security cameras? I remember hearing about ISPs where the sysadmin had parties where they would drink beer while reading user email. I'm sure there is a security camera version of this.
