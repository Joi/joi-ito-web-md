> Cynthia Webb of the Washington Post [synthesizes](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39155-2004Dec6.html) the discussion about the [new Pew study](http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Artists.Musicians_Report.pdf) [PDF] reporting that while many artists believe file sharing should be illegal, they don't necessarily believe that 1.) it's actually hurting them, 2.) the [RIAA lawsuits](http://www.eff.org/IP/P2P/riaa-v-thepeople.php) are doing anything to help the situation

Interesting report and another blow to the RIAA's argument that they are doing it for the artists.
