I'm getting an error that says "Your account is currently suspended" when I try to log into my joiitosk AIM account. Does anyone know what this error means and how I resolve it?

Update: [Article in eWeek](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1738245,00.asp) about this, but it doesn't say whether AOL is going to give us our accounts back. *Thanks to Cours for the link.*
