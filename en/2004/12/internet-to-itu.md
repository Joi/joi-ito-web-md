Ross Rader [writes a passionate response](http://www.circleid.com/channel/index/C0_1_1) to the ITU "Beyond Internet Governance" paper. This is the struggle/debate that we face today and good for Ross for articulating the position many people have but are either not in a position to say or are not informed enough to say. I would be very interested to hear the ITU's response to Ross.
