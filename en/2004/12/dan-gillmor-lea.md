[Dan Gillmor blogs](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/011101.shtml) that he is leaving the [San Jose Mercury News](http://www.mercurynews.com) next month to work on a citizen-journalism project. Awesome. Practice what you preach. Good luck Dan and let us know more about your new project when you can.
