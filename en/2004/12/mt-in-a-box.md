[Six Apart Japan](http://www.sixapart.jp/) together with Softbank just started selling [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) in a box. Actually, it's a folder. Anyway, it's doing surprising well and is currently [ranked #1 on Softbank's ECBuyers](http://www.ec-buyers.com/b2b/goods/ranking.asp?category=1_000000&shop=&cclass=) online store right now. Sorry if this sounds boastful, but we're pretty stoked.
