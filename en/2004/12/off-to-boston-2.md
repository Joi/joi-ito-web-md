I'm off to Boston today to participate in the [About Internet & Society 2004: Votes, Bits & Bytes](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/is2k4/index.html) conference at the Berkman Center. [Lots of interesting folks](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/is2k4/speakers) seem to be coming. The theme of the meeting is:
> How are technologies changing politics, both in the U.S. and abroad? The purpose of this conference is to take a skeptical, results-oriented look at the current state of politics after the 2004 election and from an international perspective in terms of issue-based campaigns, emerging business models, and new tools that affect politics both online and off. The conference will focus on the following questions:

- Has "citizenship" changed in the online era?  
- Are online business models helpful guides for politics and political organizing?  
- What international examples are promising?  
- Did the web affect the 2004 election?[My session will be at 4PM on Saturday](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/is2k4/saturday_schedule). I'm participating in the Global Voices Online section which has a [blog](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu:8080/globalvoices/) where we've been discussing the issues already. The conference starts today and goes until Saturday. If you're in Boston and are interested in this topic, I suggest you think about dropping by. Look forward to seeing everyone there!

UPDATE: The conference is supposed to be [webcast](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/is2k4/webcast). It doesn't seem to be working for me right now, but it might just be me.

UPDATE 2: Just set up #harvardbits on Freenode if anyone wants to backchannel.
