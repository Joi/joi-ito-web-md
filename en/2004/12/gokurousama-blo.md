iMorpheus has a great blog called the [Gokurousama blog](http://gokurousama.blogspot.com/).
> [Gokurousama](http://gokurousama.blogspot.com/)

> Gokurousama means "Thank you for your troubles" in Japanese and it is also the name of this blog. Gokurousama celebrates and recognizes the hard work of others.

I say *gokurousama* when I get out of taxis, when someone as completed a chore or when I pass a gardner. It's similar to, but slightly different from another great Japanese word, *otsukaresama*. *Otsukaresama* is less about thanks but still acknowledging someone for some hard work. This is often said when toasting after a hard day of work or after working together on a hard project. Interestingly, working hard together is often considered more important than winning. This, in a way, is the backbone of the socialist work ethic that drives Japan. But I digress...

The Gokurousama blog and the pictures on it are a very good way to understand the Japanese way of *gokurousama*. It's also the spirit behind good service and a very nice way to show appreciation of good service. A simple *gokurosama* will go a long way and is much more respectful than flipping someone a hundred yen coin. iMorpheus has also started a [Gokurousama flickr group](http://flickr.com/groups/gokurousama/) and has linked the group to the blog so that others can post. You can [learn more about it on his blog](http://www.somethingfromjapan.com/cgi/blosxom/blosxom.cgi/computing/gsflikcr.html).

The next time you watch an old Samurai or Yakuza movie, listen for the boss say, "Gokurojyaaa" to one of the henchmen after he returns from killing a foe. ;-p
