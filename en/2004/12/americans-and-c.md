> The Media and Society Research Group of Cornell University conducted a survey in November of Americans with respect to their attitudes towards Muslims. Nearly half (44%) of respondents favored restricting the civil rights of Muslims in some way. The press release, with links to the report, is available at [[link](http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/12-17-2004/0002639656&EDATE=)]

My next question is, of the 56% of the people who didn't favor restricting the civil rights of Muslims, what percentage are going to do anything about trying to stop this trend?
