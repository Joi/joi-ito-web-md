We just finished the board meeting where I was officially appointed to the board of ICANN. In addition, I was appointed to the [Audit Committee](http://www.icann.org/committees/audit/), the [Committee on Reconsideration](http://www.icann.org/committees/reconsideration/) and the Finance Committee.

The Audit committee is "responsible for (1) recommending the selection of external auditors to the Board, (2) receiving, reviewing, and forwarding to the Board the annual financial report of the external auditors, and (3) such other matters as may warrant its attention."

The Committee on Reconsideration is "responsible for handling requests for reconsideration of ICANN Board and staff actions. Consisting of five Directors, the Reconsideration Committee has the authority to investigate and evaluate requests for reconsideration and to make recommendations to the Board of Directors, which ultimately determines how to resolve such requests." Anyone can lodge a reconsideration request by sending email to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). A reconsideration is basically a complaint about some staff or board action or inaction. Now that we have an [Ombudsman](http://www.icann.org/announcements/announcement-24nov04-2.htm), Frank Fowlie, if the reconsideration response is not satisfactory, you can escalate to him.

The [Finance Committee](http://www.icann.org/committees/finance/) is "responsible for consulting with the President on ICANN's annual budget process; reviewing and making recommendations on the annual budget submitted by the President; and developing and recommending long range financial objectives for ICANN."
