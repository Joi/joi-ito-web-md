[Seth blogs about the top 1,000 things for a 13 year old third grader to learn](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2004/12/the_top_1000_th.html). I agree with him. The most important thing I learned in school was how to touch type.

UPDATE: Thanks to Liz for pointing out that Seth said 3rd graders, not 13 year olds. Sorry!

UPDATE 2: Ado says that Seth's post originally said 13 year old...
