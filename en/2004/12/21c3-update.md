My apologies for not blogging much substantive stuff. 21C3 is like no other conference I've been to. There are thousands of people. The center is open 24 hours a days with food 24 hours a day. People are sleeping in the halls and there is activity 24 hours a day. In a way, it is the perfect conference for jet laggy people like me. I can sleep when I want to, wander over at 3AM and there are people there hacking, talking and working. I've met some incredibly interesting people and have put faces behind a bunch of projects I've thought about and talked about, like the Liquid Democracy guys. I've been popping in and out of the sessions which are also great, but I lack the depth to be able to blog them in a meaningful way so I'll try to round up some links after I settle down.

The biggest problem is the lack of wifi network connectivity. I guess it's there, but it's either overloaded or being hacked or something. I had planned to put an IRC backchannel up during my talk (apologies to anyone who was waiting in the channel) but the connectivity in my room wasn't working. I've resorted to gprs, which means I'm doing email once a day and not reading any other blogs. I feel like I'm in a network black-out. Which is a bit ironic.

Anyway, I leave tomorrow. I'll try to blog once before then, but if I don't thanks Tim and everyone at CCC for an unforgettable experience. Also, special thanks to Jimbo and the Wikipedians for taking care of me and letting me hang out with them.
