[Rebecca blogs](http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/2004/12/bloggercorps_ha.html) about the [first BloggerCorps success story](http://www.bloggercorps.org/2004/11/bloggers_help_k.html). [BloggerCorps](http://www.bloggercorps.org/) is project to try to hook up local bloggers with important local projects who need help from bloggers. It's a great idea which just needs a bit more momentum I think. It ties in well with the Global Voices stuff. (The first version of the [manifesto](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/globalvoices/wiki/index.php/Global_Voices_Draft_Manifesto) is done.)
