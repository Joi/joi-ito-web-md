[![21C3-Male](http://joi.ito.com/images/21C3-male.png)](http://www.ccc.de/congress/2004/)

I am extremely psyched to have been invited to speak at the [Chaos Computer Club](http://www.ccc.de/)'s [21st Chaos Communication Congress](http://www.ccc.de/congress/2004/) on December 27th to 29th, 2004 at Berliner Congress Center, Berlin, Germany. I will speaking on day 2. There are lots of really interesting speakers including [Jimmy Wales](http://blog.jimmywales.com/), founder of Wikipedia on day 1, Donatella Della Ratta about Arab media also on day 2. Also, don't miss the eight annual German Lockpicking Championships. Anyway, it looks like an amazing event so if you're in Europe and feeling materialistic and boring after Christmas, come on over to Berlin and join us. I heard there will be a gaggle of Wikipedians hanging out having a parallel developers meeting as well.

The 21C3 has a [blog](http://21c3.ccc.de/weblog/) and a [wiki](https://21c3.ccc.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). The [schedule is available in various formats](http://www.ccc.de/congress/2004/fahrplan.en.html).
