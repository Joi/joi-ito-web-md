Chris Anderson is writing a book about [The Long Tail](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html) which started as [one of my favorite articles](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/10/07/the_long_tail.html) that he wrote for Wired. He has also started a [blog](http://www.thelongtail.com) about the Long Tail. [The original article is online at Wired.](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html)
