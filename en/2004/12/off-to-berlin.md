I'll off to Berlin in a few hours. I'm going to the [21st Chaos Communication Congress](http://www.ccc.de/congress/2004/). I will be speaking about the [State of Emergent Democracy](http://www.ccc.de/congress/2004/fahrplan/event/159.en.html). (I am working on my [talking points on my wiki](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/?21C3_2004).) I usually print out the conference schedule in case the immigration officer wants to know what I am going to be doing in their country, but I noticed that the schedule has stuff like: Lockpicking, Bluetooth Hacking, GameCube Hacking, Hidden Data in Internet Published Documents, Practical Mac OS X Insecurity, SAP R/3 Protocol Reverse Engineering... Maybe I won't carry a printout of this schedule after all. There is a [How to Survive](https://21c3.ccc.de/wiki/index.php/How_to_Survive) page on the wiki about how to lock down your computer for use on the network at the conference. Very good advice for anyone going to any conference with an open LAN, but a bit ominous when you are going to be a conference attended by a lot of serious hackers. I have tried feebly to prepare, but please be nice to me.

It looks like there will be a whole platoon of [Wikipedians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) and some [Croquet](http://www.opencroquet.org/) folks too. Lots of people I haven't seen for awhile as well. Looking forward to seeing everyone. See you soon on the other side.
