Fortune Magazine's [David Kirkpatrick](http://joi.typepad.com/photos/brainstorm2003/cimg0004.html) and Daniel Roth have just posted [an excellent article about blogging](http://www.fortune.com/fortune/technology/articles/0,15114,1011763,00.html). There are interviews with the usual suspects. A lot of the stories will be familiar to heavy blog readers but it's a great summary of what's going on and a "must send" link to people you know who still don't understand blogs. Extra credit for making the article accessible with a permalink and no registration. Minus points for not linking to the bloggers they interview. Apparently the print version has lots of cool charts so I'm going to pick up the newsstand version too.
