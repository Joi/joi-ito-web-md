Meetings in the main auditorium at the ICANN meeting in Cape Town, South Africa December 1-5 are [being webcast](http://www.icann.org/meetings/capetown/).

Right now, [the Workshop on the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS)](http://www.icann.org/meetings/capetown/icann-wsis-workshop-01dec04.htm) is on.

I will be hanging out on #icann on irc.freenode.net when I'm available.
