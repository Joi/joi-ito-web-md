[James Seng](http://james.seng.cc/archives/2004/12/06/ietf-style_icann.html) and [Elliot Noss](http://enoss.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2004/12/5/197083.html) have interesting responses to an [anonymous post](http://scrawford.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2004/12/4/196476.html) on Susan Crawford's blog calling for the reformation of the Internet. Read the anonymous post first, then Elliot, then James. They all represent a small view into the diversity of intelligent opinions on the future of the ICANN.
