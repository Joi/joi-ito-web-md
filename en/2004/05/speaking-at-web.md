I will be speaking at a Conference in Naples on June 4. The conference is called: Culture Digitali: I WEBLOG E LA NUOVA SFERA PUBBLICA, or Weblogs and New Public Opinion. The Conference has [a blog](http://blogosphere.typepad.com/blogosphere/) and here is the [entry with the program](http://blogosphere.typepad.com/blogosphere/2004/04/index.html#a0001298478).

The conference registration is not yet open, but I will blog about it when it opens.

Some of us are thinking about getting together for lunch on June 5. If you want to hang out with us, please [fill out this form](http://www.bookcafe.net/blog/lunch.cfm). Look forward to meeting everyone.
