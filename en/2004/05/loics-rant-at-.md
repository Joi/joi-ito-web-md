![Loic Le Meur at the World Economic Forum](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/images/Capture018.jpg "Loic Le Meur at the World Economic Forum") [Loic's rant at the European WEF meeting.](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2004/05/video_clip_of_m.html) With his French accent, Loic criticizes France and is our designated agitator at the Warsaw meeting. Wish I had been there to heckle him. ;-)

Interesting talk. [Loic's soliciting comments on his blog.](http://www.loiclemeur.com)
