[Louisiana to ban saggy, butt-crack-exposing pants](http://www.2theadvocate.com/stories/050704/new_butts001.shtml) *via [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/05/07/louisiana_to_ban_sag.html)*.

This is really funny because many years ago I had the honor of being with the mayor of New Orleans during Mardi Gras. I distinctly remember the mayor talking about his new "moon pants". They were pants that you could easily zip down the back of and moon people from the balcony. I guess he can't wear them anymore...
