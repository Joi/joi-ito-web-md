[The Mirror ran a story about British soldiers torturing Iraqi prisoners with photos](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/tm_objectid=14199634&method=full&siteid=50143&headline=shame-of-abuse-by-brit-troops-name_page.html). There is a lot of question about the legitimacy of the photos. [The BBC has a organized list of the claims against their authenticity and the rebuttals.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3680327.stm)

The Express says soldiers who originally tried to sell the story of mistreatment were told it would be "worth a fortune if there were corroborating pictures and weeks later they produced them".This sort of commercial and unethical behavior by the media is really disgusting. I guess The Mirror is still standing by their claims, but it seems like they are in a pretty weak position now.
