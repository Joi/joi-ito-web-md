My, "traditionally, the (content) industry has been wrong about how consumers use these devices" [comment at Milia](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/04/02/milia_miptv_update.html) seems to have become a popular quote in the media and has [made it all the way to Al Jazeera](http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/77ECD946-E53C-4E4E-89CE-9A6AAE6D8E89.htm). ;-)
