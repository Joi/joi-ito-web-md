[The New York Times has an article about how evil IRC is](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/06/technology/circuits/06chat.html?ex=1399176000&en=af9c4d7079c4aa04&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND).

> Still, I.R.C. perhaps most closely resembles the cantina scene in "Star Wars'': a louche hangout of digital smugglers, pirates, curiosity seekers and the people who love them (or hunt them). There seem to be I.R.C. channels dedicated to every sexual fetish, and I.R.C. users speculate that terrorists also use the networks to communicate in relative obscurity.

UPDATE: [Dan Gillmor chimes](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/010341.shtml#010341) in and points out that maybe they're going to try to regulate IRC. Boy that would suck and not work.

UPDATE 2: [Suw writes a letter to the editor](http://chocnvodka.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2004/5/6/52890.html).
