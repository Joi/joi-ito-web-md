I will be on a panel at a conference in Helsinki on June 10. It is the [Annual Meeting of the International Network of Private Business Organizations - COMPETITIVENESS THROUGH CREATIVITY](http://www.unifile.fi/tapahtumat/EVA/programme.html). I will be representing the [Keizai Doyukai](http://www.doyukai.or.jp/en/) (The Japan Association of Corporate Executives) and will be speaking about "Creativity and Innovation - Rare Virtue or New Standard?". I'm not sure who they're inviting to participate, but if you're going, please let me know.
