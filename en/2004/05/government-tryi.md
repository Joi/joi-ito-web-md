The Japanese government is taking this way too far and totally agree with the author of this article that this is a bad bad thing. [As I've said before](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/04/12/abe_wants_to_revise_constitution_to_use_sdf_in_hostage_crisis.html), legislation during emotionally charged times often ends up being stupid and poorly thought through. The ramifications of such a law would be devastating for NGO's and aid workers from Japan, just when such activity is becoming recognized. It almost feels like some stupid conspiracy to use this incident to squash the NGO's in Japan. Bah. I have less and less respect for the Japanese government every day.
