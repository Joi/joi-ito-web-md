It's been a hard week for everyone at [Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/) with the [difficulty with the launch of the Movable Type 3](http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/05/movable_type_de.shtml) and the licensing and communications about this. Anil seems to feel quite responsible. It sounds a bit like Rummy getting set up to be the fall guy, but fine. It was Anil's fault. ;-)

Having said that, I think everyone at Six Apart feels very responsible and is working really hard listening to all the feedback and fixing the licenses and communications of them. They're sincerely trying to be "good" so I'd appreciate any slack people are willing to cut them. Also, please continue to send them and myself ideas and [feedback](http://www.sixapart.com/log/2004/05/how_are_you_usi.shtml) on how we can make the MT 3 license better for everyone. Thanks!
