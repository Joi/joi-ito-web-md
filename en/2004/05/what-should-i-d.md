As you can see, I have to be in Naples on June 4 and Helsinki on June 10. It's kind of a waste to fly back to Japan and turn around and fly back to Europe again. Is there anything interesting going on, or can we make something interesting happen in Europe between June 4 and June 10? I've [started a wiki page](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/JoiItoJune2004) to think about what to do between the 4th and the 10th. If you have any ideas, let me know. Thanks!
