Just finished reading the Galley Proof of *[We, the Media: Grassroots Journalism by the People, for the People](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/0596007337/index.html)* by [Dan Gillmor](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/). [O'Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/) is the publisher and it should be coming out mid-July. The book will be published under a [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org/) license and you will be able to download it free for non-commercial use.

Dan is one of the few professional journalists that really understands the impact of blogs and other new technologies on journalism. It's amazing [how many professional journalists I know](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/05/16/dinner_with_markoff_and_dvorak.html) pooh pooh blogs and keep on chugging like nothing is changing. *We, the Media* is a excellent book that should be enlightening and humbling for professional journalists. It is also a great guide for us little "j" journalists about what the possibilities are as well as what the difficulties will be. Anyway, it's an amazingly important book for anyone interested in journalism and democracy. It goes well with Lawrence Lessig's [*Free Culture*](http://free-culture.org/freecontent/) and Howard Rheingold's [*Smart Mobs*](http://www.smartmobs.com/index.html).
