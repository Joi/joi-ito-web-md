Most people are aware that [Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/) got a lot of feedback on the release of [Movable Type 3.0](http://www.movabletype.org/) and there was a bit of confusion as well. [Mena has a good post](http://www.sixapart.com/log/2004/05/movable_type_30.shtml) that addresses many of the issues people have been asking about.
