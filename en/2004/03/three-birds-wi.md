Larry needs to get rid of these books, you REALLY need to read this book, Creative Commons needs the money. Do the right thing. If you haven't read Future of Ideas, donate to CC now and get a copy of Larry's last book now.

> As I just said, I’ve got a new book coming out in about ten days. To clear the shelves, and to thank blog readers, I’ve got a few hardcover copies of my last book, [The Future of Ideas](http://www.the-future-of-ideas.com/), that I’ll happily send to anyone who makes a contribution of at least $5 to [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/). To qualify for this special offer, either click on the PayPal logo, or send a check to Creative Commons at 559 Nathan Abbott Way, Palo Alto, CA 94305. If you’d like the book defaced with my signature, then send an email after you order to llynch at stanford.edu.
