I have decided to take on an additional role outside of [Neoteny](http://blog.neoteny.com/neoteny/) working with [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/)'s team heading their exploration of opportunities in the mobile and international realms.

I will be splitting my time between Neoteny, [Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/) and Technorati as my primary responsibilities with board positions on [SocialText](http://www.socialtext.com/), [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) and a few other companies and non-profits as additional roles.
