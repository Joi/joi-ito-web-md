I've been talking a lot about the Full-Time Intimate Community lately. I comes from work that [Misa Matsuda](http://www10.plala.or.jp/misamatsuda/) is doing at her lab and I heard about this from [my sister](http://itofisher.com/mito/) who is doing a lot of work in this area. It's a study about the mobile phone email communications of people in Japan and how people seem to keep in close contact with four or five people using a constant stream of messages. The point is that the content of the messages aren't as important as the fact that the people in this "Full-Time Intimate Community" are aware of the current state (awake, in bus, at school, happy, sad) of each other. It's a  [Granovetter "strong tie" community](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/08/16/jobs_and_the_strength_of_weak_ties.html). Granovetter talks about how more valuable content flowed over "weak ties" and talked about the "strength of weak ties", but in the FTIC, it's not the "content" but rather the intimacy that is being transmitted. (Help me out here academics. I'm getting in a bit over my head. ;-p ) It's very much part of my "context vs content" rant about how presence and context is, in ways, more interesting than content and that content is just the carrier signal or substrate upon which community is built.

The fact that [Glenn picked up "Full-Time Intimacy" as his title](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/archive/2004/03/#4081) for the blog entry about the [NPR](http://npr.org/) [SXSW](http://sxsw.com/) [audio postcard](http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=1783600) by [Mary Bridges](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/home/mary_bridges) and [Benjamen Walker](http://yourlight.org/) makes me think that this word/meme has legs. ;-)
