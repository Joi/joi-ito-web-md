[Mailblocks](http://about.mailblocks.com/) was working well for me ever since it it [failed on my in January.](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/01/05/mailblockscom_is_hosed.html) At the time, I told them that they should have an outages page so that users could find out why mail wasn't working and when it might be back up.

This time, I can access the mailbox, but I haven't been able to receive any new mail for about 8.5 hrs. So if you're trying to reach me urgently, please email me or leave a comment here.

They don't have any information on their page or replied to the email I've sent. hmm...

I am joi\_ito at mac.com on AIM.

UPDATE: FYI. [Mailblocks was acquired by AOL.](http://www.clickz.com/news/article.php/3390481)
