I'm at Narita airport now on my to Seattle for a thingie at Microsoft. I hate the immigration at Seattle. I've had more bad experiences there than any other US port of entry I've ever been to. I've seen fathers deported because the checked "tourist" and mumbled something about visiting company friends and have had friends grilled for hours. I have also been treated rather poorly several times. I heard from someone that they trained immigration officers in Seattle. In any case, I'm not looking forward to it. I know my friends in the US State Department read this blog. {{waves to State Department readers}} If you don't see me blogging about landing safely in Seattle, do you mind giving Seattle immigrations a call to see if I'm stuck? Thanks.

Anyway, I'll probably see you soon from Seattle.

UPDATE: I took my chances with a sort of mean looking officer, but he turned out to be a gas. "Who are you here to see?" "Microsoft" "Why would you want to see THEM? [sarcastic smile]" "They asked me to speak" "Well, have a few sakes for me before you go on stage. hehe."

Unfortunately, he was so busy entertaining me that he forgot to stamp my customs papers and I got turned away at the exit and had to go back and get the stamp from him.

But it was funny and pleasant so I eat my words. I don't hate Seattle airport... right now.
