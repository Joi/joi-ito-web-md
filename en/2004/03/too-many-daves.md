[The blogs have created another Dave.](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002521.html) Now don't get me wrong. Some of my best friends are Daves, but we definitely have too many Daves.

Well, she did. And that wasn't a smart thing to do.  
You see, when she wants one, and calls out "Yoo-Hoo!  
Come into the house, Dave!" she doesn't get one.  
All twenty-three Daves of hers come on the run!

This makes things quite difficult at the McCaves'  
As you can imagine, with so many Daves.  
And often she wishes that, when they were born,  
She had named one of them Bodkin Van Horn.  
And one of them Hoos-Foos. And one of them Snimm.  
And one of them Hot-Shot. And one Sunny Jim.  
Another one Putt-Putt. Another one Moon Face.  
Another one Marvin O'Gravel Balloon Face.  
And one of them Zanzibar Buck-Buck McFate...

But she didn't do it. And now it's too late.
