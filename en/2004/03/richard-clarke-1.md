> ...but I can't remember any current high-ranking member of the Bush Administration ever saying anything like what Richard Clarke said today:
> > Mr. Clarke began his testimony before the bipartisan, 10-member panel, formally known as the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, with an apology to relatives of the 3,000 people killed on Sept. 11, 2001.

> "Your government failed you," he said, his voice close to breaking. "Those entrusted with protecting you failed you, and I failed you."
>
> "We tried hard," Mr. Clarke went on, "but that doesn't matter, because we failed. And for that failure, I would ask -- once all the facts are out -- for your understanding and your forgiveness."

If the President, any member of his Cabinet, or any other high-ranking political appointee of his has apologized for allowing the 9/11 attacks to take place on their watch, I'd like to know about it.
