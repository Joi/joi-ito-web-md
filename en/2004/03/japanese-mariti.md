I think this is old news on the Net, but the [Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force](http://www.jda.go.jp/JMSDF/event/cm_p/index.html) has produced an ad that is has begun to show on big screens at major intersections now and will soon be on TV. It's a bit embarrassing as a Japanese, but I guess it makes us look less threatening...
