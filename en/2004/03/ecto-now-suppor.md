[Ecto](http://www.kung-foo.tv/ecto/) [now supports](http://www.kung-foo.tv/blog/archives/000817.php "Ecto supports del.icio.us") [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/). It allows me now to take any URL using in a blog post and submit it to del.icio.us (the URL bookmark exchange) with one click from inside of Ecto (my blogging client). You can see all of these URLs under the delicious tab in my sidebar. You can also subscribe to the URLs in my [delicious feed](http://del.icio.us/rss/joi_ito) as an RSS feed.
