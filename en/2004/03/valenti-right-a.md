I recently [met Jack at a conference last year](http://joi.typepad.com/photos/brainstorm2003/cimg0021.html) but I first met Jack when I was working in Hollywood and was a translator at a meeting between him and the chairman of NHK, the Japanese public broadcasting company. I also worked with Jack's son, John, on [Indian Runner](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102116/). Jack always struck me as smart and charming and I have the same impression of him that Dan does. Jack gave Creative Commons a video message endorsement when Creative Commons launched. I agree with Dan that although I disagree violently with many of the things Jack stands for, I will miss him and wish all of our opponents were so gracious.
