> Thanks to the lessons explained by others ([Cory](http://www.craphound.com/down/download.php)), and the courage of a great publisher ([Penguin](http://us.penguingroup.com/Book/BookFrame/0,1007,,00.html?id=1594200068)), [Free Culture](http://free-culture.org) launches today with a free online version of the book, licensed under a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org) license. You can get the book [here](http://www.free-culture.cc/freecontent/), though at the moment, only the bittorrent version is apparently up. Later today, there will be a direct download available from the [Free Culture](http://free-culture.org) site, and from the [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1594200068/ref=ase_lessigorg-20/104-6231054-0522308?v=glance&s=books) site.
