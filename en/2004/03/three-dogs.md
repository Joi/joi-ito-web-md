Not that most of you will care, but we have three dogs now. Our friend moved to a new apartment and couldn't keep her dog, Dino. Dino's a bit stressed from being in quarantine at Narita for a month. We got Pookie from another neighbor. Anyway, Bo, Pookie and Dino are running around the house right now like the cartoon Tasmanian devil.
