Off to Austin for today [SXSW](http://www.sxsw.com/) and the [Wireless Future](http://www.wirelessfuture.org/) conference. I'll be there until the 17th.

[Logistics are on the wiki](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/JoiTexas). I will be moderating a panel on wireless gaming on Monday from 15:30 and participating in a panel on Wireless and Grassroots Innovation on Tuesday from 15:30.

If you're in Austin, lets hook up.
