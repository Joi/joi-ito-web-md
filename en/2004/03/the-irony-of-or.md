Isn't it funny/interesting that [Wallop](http://mywallop.com/), Microsoft's social networking project is built using flash, xml and sql while [Orkut](http://www.orkut.com/), Google's social network project is built using .Net and C#? Microsoft avoids being locked into the Microsoft platform while Orkut is completely locked in. hmmm... What does this mean?
