[Umm... thanks Betsy](http://betsydevine.weblogger.com/2004/03/23#a1123). But I would rather have [been superman](http://betsydevine.weblogger.com/2003/10/05 ). But I guess it's better than [this](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/10/24/its_a_girl_congratulations_utsumikun_and_fujikosan.html#n001659).

My photoshopping has definitely gotten better since I've started blogging.
