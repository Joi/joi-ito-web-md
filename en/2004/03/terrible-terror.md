In case you're just waking up and reading blogs before reading the news. There has been a terrible terrorist incident in Spain.

[News on CNN.com](http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/03/11/spain.blasts/index.html).

The last count I saw was over 170 192 people dead. Several commuter trains in the early morning to Madrid. Government says it was the ETA.

Victor has [compiled a lot of information on the attack](http://rvr.bloxus.com/historias/1767).
