In order to 1) mess around with [TypePad](https://www.typepad.com/) more, 2) allow me to indulge my gadget obsession with complete abandonment and 3) experiment with multiple blogs, I've decided to start a blog about [Joi Ito's Stuff](http://joi.typepad.com/stuff/). It is "a blog about stuff that I have, why I have it, what I'm doing with it and how I feel about it." I have no idea if this is a good idea or not, but starting blogs on New Year's Day seems like a good idea to me.
