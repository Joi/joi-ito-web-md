Rebecca MacKinnon, the Tokyo bureau chief of CNN and [fellow GLT](http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/Forum+Announces+its+One+Hundred+New+Global+Leaders+for+Tomorrow+2003) is taking leave-of-absence to be a media fellow at the Shorenstein Center at Harvard. We've talked a lot in the past about blogging and the future of journalism and I'm happy that she's going to jump out and take a bird's eye view of all this at what I think is the perfect time to be taking a bird's eye view of journalism.

[Rebecca has started a blog](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/techjournalism/). Good luck and welcome to our world. ;-)
