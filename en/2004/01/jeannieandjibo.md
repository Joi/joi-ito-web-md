If you hang out on [#joiito](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel) or are interested in learning more and plan to be at ETech, please [vote for](http://wiki.oreillynet.com/etech/pub?ParticipantSessions), [sign up for and contribute ideas to](http://wiki.oreillynet.com/etech/hosted.conf?JeannieAndJibot) the session we are planning. We're going to try to play with RFID's and the Jeannie's cafe idea and we need a head-count so please sign up early if you're interested. Hopefully [Hecklebot](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/HeckleBot) will be there as well.
