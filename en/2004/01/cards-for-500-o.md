[Hugh aka gapingvoid](http://www.gapingvoid.com), one of my favorite online cartoonists, let me pick a cartoon and sent me 500 business cards with my contact info on once side, and this image on the other. After getting a stack of 500 cards that say, "You are the most important person in my Life" I realized the irony and realized that maybe I chose the wrong phrase. ;-p

I do think his idea of cartoons on business cards is a cool idea.

So what I need is a bunch of different cards ranging from "You are the most important person in my Life" to "Talk to the hand." Then I can choose which cards to give to people. This would be the intentional physical version of what [Cory doesn't like about social software](http://www.diepunyhumans.com/archives/006847.html).

*Of course, I would only give "Talk to the hand" to someone as a joke... really.*
