It's kind of funny when [Basil's TiVo thinks he's gay](http://www.dfw.com/mld/startelegram/living/4662397.htm) and [Kevin's Outlook thinks Scoble's writing is junk](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/01/02.html#a6038), but it won't be funny when [CAPPS II thinks you're a terrorist](http://www.wired.com/news/privacy/0,1848,61553,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_1).
