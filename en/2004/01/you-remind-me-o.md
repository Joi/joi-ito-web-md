I remember when everyone shouted into their cell phones and thought that their batteries drained faster when they made long distance phones. I remember when people (who now have cell phones) swore to me that they'd never have a cell phone. I remember when cell phones looked more like military radios. I think it's fine to gripe about technology, but I would warn those people who swear they'll never use a technology. Technology evolves and so do social norms.

[We've been having a dialog recently about the relationship between social norms and technology](http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2003/12/29/users_drive_policy.php). I think this is part of the same dialog. New technologies disrupt our habits and our norms and what we feel comfortable with. I am an early adopter type who uses every technology possible and I try to wrap my life around it all. Some people try the technology and point out the tensions. Some people ignore the technology. Technology evolves along with the social norms. When it works well, we end up with a technology that contributes to society in some way and becomes a seamless part of our social norms. When it doesn't work well it either damages society or does not integrate and is discarded.

Being the [techno-utopian optimist](http://www.theregister.com/content/archive/30087.html) that I am, I think that writing off [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) and IM as annoying is a big mistake. They are what military radios were to the cell phones of today. I think it's important to take what [David Weinberger](http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/01/05/new_rule_dont_call_me_if_you_dont_know_me.php) and [danah](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/001399.html#001399) have to say about the tensions they create and thinking about how to make presence more granular, how to make it easier to manage the emission of your presence information and control access to you. What DOES free VoIP really mean? [Can it be a background thing that allows us to continue to focus on our work instead of being an interruption?](http://barlow.typepad.com/barlowfriendz/2003/12/entering_casual.html) I am very excited by IM and VoIP and think that the tensions and the annoyances they are creating is a good a reason as any to dive into the privacy, identity, presence and interop issues that we've been talking about for so long. The more annoying it becomes, the more people will care about these issues.
