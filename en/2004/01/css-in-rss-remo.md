I've removed the [CSS Stylesheets in my RSS feed](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/12/30/css_in_rss_feed.html) until further notice. I'll let the discussions play out and will wait for the tool builders to decide what is best before I start pushing on this.

Thanks for all of the interesting feedback everyone.
