I am awake at 3:45 AM (Helsinki time) because the fire alarm went off in the hallway. (I'm in the Radisson SAS Seaside Hotel in Helsinki.) Then the TV turned on. (Yay! A message.) The TV started flashing "Fire Alarm" and blaring, "Please remain calm. We are investigating the cause." The volume steadily got louder until the TV was full blast. (I couldn't turn down the volume.) Then the TV suddenly turned off. The alarm in the hallway continued. Then turned off. Then turned on. And off... over and over for awhile. Finally the alarm stopped. Either the operator of the TV emergency notification system was burned alive or they had forgotten to tell us to "it was nothing." Finally, I called down to the front desk and they said, "oh, it was nothing." Doh. This is the second false hotel fire alarm in 6 months or so. What a drag. This is sort of like hotel spam. Well, not really, but it's really annoying.

My [declaration to AKMA](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/09/12/eternal_flame.html) DID flash through my head though...
