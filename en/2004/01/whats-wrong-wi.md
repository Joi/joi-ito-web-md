[I've been accused of using binary logic](http://www.purselipsquarejaw.org/2004_01_01_blogger_archives.php?show_id=107341485021099462#bk_107341485021099462) and am still having a very difficult time understanding the problem with it. [Anne Galloway's blog](http://www.purselipsquarejaw.org/) has very high quality readership so I am fascinated by the discussion, but I still need some help understanding. Anne, I hate to highjack the comments section on your blog entry, but I have a feeling I'm still missing a very important point.
