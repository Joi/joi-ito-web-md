I've been invited to be say something at the [Social Computing Symposium at Microsoft](http://weblogs.asp.net/korbyp/archive/2004/01/23/62317.aspx). I'm looking forward to hanging out with some of my favorite people. (Maybe the first opportunity for me to speak at the same conference as [my sister](http://itofisher.com/mito/) too...) I'm REALLY interested in what Microsoft is thinking about this space, and it appears that they are doing a lot of thinking.
