[danah has finally posted her long awaited rant](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/30/venting_my_contempt_for_orkut.html#004004) on [Orkut](http://www.orkut.com/). Orkut, in case you don't know, is the social networking site developed by a guy at Google. [Orkut also means "orgasm" in Finnish](http://www.ecyrd.com/ButtUgly/Wiki.jsp?page=Main_blogentry_230104_1). I've been through so many of these now that I'm playing around. When it's running, it's fast so I'm adding everyone I recognize, (I guess danah would call this "misbehaving") and trying to beat Marc Canter in my local game of "king of the mountain." Lucky for me, [he's been thrown in jail](http://blogs.it/0100198/2004/01/29.html#a2216). Orkut's kind of like... people surfing. As danah says, I do not yet know what I'm going to do when I get there, but I'm sure there'll be another toy to play with by then. ;-)

Joking aside, it's a nice interface and seems to aggregate a lot of features from other similar services, but I agree with danah's points.
