[Ev writes about Google's new quicklink](http://www.evhead.com/archives/2004_01_01_archive_default.asp#107353788786515206) for whois. If you search for "whois [domain]" on Google you will get a link to a search on [www.ratite.com's Global Whois service](http://www.ratite.com/) for the domain name. I guess this is useful for people who won't touch a command line, but I don't think I'd ever use it. I will continue to open a terminal window and type "whois google.com". That way I can continue to see whois spam too. ;-)
