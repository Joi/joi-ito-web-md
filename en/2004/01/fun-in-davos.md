My goal this year is to have fun in Davos. This will be my fourth [World Economic Forum Annual Meeting](http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/Annual+Meeting+2004) and the third time that I will be attending it in Davos, Switzerland. (One year, it was in New York.) This year's meeting will be January 21-25. The meetings are always very interesting and I meet lots of people, but I don't usually have much of what I would call "fun". I don't know enough people and I get a little tired of meeting important person after important person who says, "so, what do you do?" It's very humbling to go to a conference where just about everyone is more important than you and has NO IDEA who you are, but it's tiring. The other problem is that for some reason, there is always a screw-up in my invitation and I end up registering the very last minute. There are never enough hotel rooms to go around so I always get stuck with the most inconvenient hotel room and find myself stomping through blizzards in a suit. This year is the same. At least I didn't end up in "hotel igloo" which is where people who end up not getting a room go.

I usually have fun at conferences by picking a few "conference buddies" to hang out with and share notes with. I'm hoping that this year a few of my [GLT](http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/Global+Leaders+for+Tomorrow+%28GLTs%29) and [Social Entrepreneur](http://www.schwabfound.org/schwabentrepreneurs.htm) friends will be there who I can hang out with.

I will be speaking at two sessions. I will be participating in a discussion with the Club of Media Leaders -- a community of 30 editors in chief from leading global news outlets and topic will be "Rethinking the Net -- Internet Media Strategy, Wireless, Bloggers and Others" from 10.45 to 12.00 on the 21st of January. On Thursday the 22nd of January I will be on a panel titled <Will Mainstream Media Co-opt Blogs and the Internet?> which will be open to the general audience. If you're planning on coming to either of these, let me know so I can feel like at least someone else there knows what I'm talking about.

In any event, if you're going to be in Davos for the meeting and can/want to hang out, please [drop me an email](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#016b68756e2c67746f686f6560776e72416c60686d636d6e626a722f626e6c) or post a comment here.
