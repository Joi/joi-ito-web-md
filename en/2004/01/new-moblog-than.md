Thanks to [Boris](http://bopuc.levendis.com/) and chicgeek for making me [a new moblog](http://joi.ito.com/moblog2/). I ripped off the "crop it square" look from [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com/) and Boris and chicgeek figured out that categories made sense and rewrote the scripts. Boris did the design with his usual magic and chicgeek did the coding. Thanks a lot guys. It looks/works MUCH better. It's officially upgraded from [version .2 alpha](http://joi.ito.com/moblog/) straight to [version 2.](http://joi.ito.com/moblog2/) ;-)
