I just received this by email from a friend.
> WELCOME TO THE WAR IN IRAQ

Attached is actual night-vision footage shot from a U.S. Apache attack helicopter engaging Iraqis, whom allegedly were attempting to launch a Stinger missile at the Apache. The Apache responds with approximately one-hundred rounds of 30mm cannon fire, which is, ironically, the least powerful weapons system onboard the helicopter. The footage has been "dumbed down" to VHS resolution before conversion to MPEG, since the actual night-vision system on the Apache provides a much sharper and more detailed image.

I realize that the targets were probably a threat to the helicopter and the actions within the rules of engagement, but it is disturbing none the less.

UPDATE: The server load was getting to high so I removed the direct link to the file. You can get it via bit torrent. ([4.65 MB mpeg bit torrent file](http://joi.ito.com/movies/apache_helicopter_vs_iraqis-mpeg.torrent)) If you don't know what bit torrent is or don't have it, check out [the web page](http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/).

UPDATE 2: The video was aired on abc news and is [available on their site](http://abcnews.go.com/sections/WNT/US/apache_video_040109-1.html). *via [davee](http://www.owlmonkey.com/)*
