For those of you who continue to argue that most blogs and links between blogs are an echo chamber, go to [Barlow's blog](http://blog.barlowfriendz.net/) and take a look. Barlow has [stepped out of his Barlowfriendz mailing list into a community which includes the Barlowenemiez](http://barlow.typepad.com/barlowfriendz/2003/12/safire_takes_a_.html). [Barlow eloquently discusses the experience of stepping out of the echo chamber](http://barlow.typepad.com/barlowfriendz/2004/01/welcome_barlowe.html).
