The World Economic Forum has posted [a pdf summary](http://www.weforum.org/pdf/Session_Summaries2004/092e.pdf) of the blogging panel. As usual, the tone isn't the same as what I experienced and they got most of what I said, but I think my emphasis was a bit different. I hope [Loic gets his video transcript up](http://www.u-blog.com/loic/note/57175) so you can decide interpret it yourself.
