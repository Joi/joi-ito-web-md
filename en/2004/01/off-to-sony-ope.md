I'm off again to the Sony Open Forum tomorrow. It's an annual event. The main event is Sony's sponsorship of a golf tournament, but there is also a small forum where Chairman Idei invites executives of Sony and several other people to discuss some of the key topics for the year. [Last year I was invited to speak about the future of Japan](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/01/15/strange_day_dave_farber_and_john_patrick_magically_appear.html). This year I'm going to be talking about media consumption and the future of media. My talk will kick off a discussion session. The conference itself is not public, but I'm assuming my comments are. [I've put my talking notes](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/SonyOpenForumSpeech04) on my wiki and [Kevin Marks](http://epeus.blogspot.com/), [Roger Wood](http://www.rojisan.com/blog/) and [danah boyd](www.zephoria.org/thoughts/) have [contributed some thoughts on a page about media consumption](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/mediaconsumption). The actual talk isn't for a few more days so any thoughts you might have would be greatly appreciated. Please add them to the wiki. Thanks!
