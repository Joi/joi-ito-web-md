Just got back from Munakata Shrine. This year we moved to a small village in Chiba and Mizuka and I decided to go to the local shrine to pay our New Years respects. At Munakata Shrine, we met many of our neighbors, clensed ourselves and payed our respects. I've just [uploaded some photos](http://joi.typepad.com/photos/new_years_2004/).

Anyway, Happy New Year EVERYBODY!
