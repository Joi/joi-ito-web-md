I did a quick review of the 2003 stats for this site. [Last time I posted my stats](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/02/joi_itos_web_site_stats.html), [Jeffrey Zeldman slammed my bad manners](http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0203c.shtml#missedmanners), but [Cory thought it was fine](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/02/joi_itos_web_site_stats.html#n004643) and pointed out that he posts his stats ever new year. [Liz points out in that thread](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/02/joi_itos_web_site_stats.html#n004645) that my site includes comments (and puts them in the same html as my entry for all of Google to index). Of the 8475 posts on my blog, 1247 are entries from me and 7288 are comments from YOU. This blog is more about community than a site with no participation.

A quick survey of people on [#joiito](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel) about whether I should post stats also resulted in mixed reactions.

So, thus justified (and confused), I present (some of) my stats (in the continuation in an attempt to be a LITTLE PC).

And for the record, I don't feel inferior to sites that have more traffic than me and I don't chuckle at sites that have less.
