In my highly enlightened state this morning, I mused about the idea of a multi-author blog about resisting addiction. People could share their experience and we could also discuss the meta-issue of creating a network to support people who are trying to quit. I'm pretty set on getting this started today so I'm soliciting ideas before I kick it off. I need a name and a few key things to focus on. I guess that figuring out the URL is pretty important. Any ideas?
