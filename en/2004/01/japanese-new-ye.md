[![](http://joi.ito.com/images2/feast-tm.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/images2/feast.jpg)The Japanese holiday season is inverted compared to the US. Christmas is spent as a partying frenzy and as we approach the New Year things slow down. The days before New Year, we spend cleaning our houses and preparing *osechi*. *Osechi* is food that keeps well and tastes OK cold. Cooking a lot of *osechi* allowed the women (who typically did the cooking in the house) to take a break for a few days during the new year. The idea is to cook up a bunch of *osechi*, [eat your noodles](http://joi.typepad.com/photos/new_years_2004/photo_library_33.html), [go to the shrine](http://joi.typepad.com/photos/new_years_2004/photo_library_35.html), [ask for good luck](http://joi.typepad.com/photos/new_years_2004/photo_library_47.html), and take a break. During the first few days of the new year, you visit family, eat *osechi* and basically chill out.

I think this is more efficient than the US form where you wake up drunk and hung over on in the New Year with a fuzzy recollection of a bunch of unrealistic New Years resolutions.

Yesterday, I helped Mizuka clean the house, she did most of the cooking (*osechi* is a bit of an art) and we had her family over for New Years *osechi* brunch. I passed out (sober) on the floor cuddling with Bo and slept for 18 hours.
