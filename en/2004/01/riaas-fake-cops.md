Langley is Western regional coordinator for the RIAA Anti-Piracy Unit.I feel sorry for [Sir Howard Stringer](http://joi.ito.com/moblog2/entries/2004/01/14/007838.html). I'm glad I don't have to hang out with people like the [RIAA](http://www.riaa.com/). ([tech dirt on how Sir Howard might save Sony Music](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20030702/0939208_F.shtml))

I wonder just how much racism in the name of "profiling" will be tolerated. [Since the RIAA links piracy to terrorism](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/07/20/software_and_music_piracy_linked_to_terrorism.html), I suppose they'll expect us to tolerate a lot.
