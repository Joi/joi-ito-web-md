I remember learning this lesson in the past. NEVER TRUST GATE AGENTS. My Lufthansa flight from Zurich to Munich was over an hour delayed. My transfer for my flight to Tokyo was very short and I thought I would miss my flight so I asked them to route me through Frankfurt. They told me all flights out of Munich were late and I would be OK. We arrived in Munich and we walked off the plane and were told to walk up an escalator going the wrong direction. Then at the top of the escalator, the door was locked and we had a pile-up. I heard cussing in a variety of languages. It was funny. We got out and all of the displays for connecting flights were blank.

I went to the gate, and of course the flight had left. I went to the service counter and I got the "are you stupid?" look and was told that I should take the next flight to Frankfurt.

Anyway, I better go board my next flight on my Lufthansa hub-a-thon...
