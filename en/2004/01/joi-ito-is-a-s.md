Many people seem to think I'm a woman because my name is rather gender neutral if not feminine. I am a short, straight, 37-year-old, Japanese guy who lives in Japan. I've noticed some people are very careful not to reveal their gender on their blogs. Others are clear. Others probably fake it. I'm sure [danah](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/) can give us a list of people for whom it is much more complicated than "are your male or female." Anyway, I suppose I should make it more clear, but where? Picture in my "[about section](http://joi.ito.com/static/aboutjoi.html)"?

UPDATE: I just posted a picture. I hope this helps. I just realized how few pictures I have of myself...
