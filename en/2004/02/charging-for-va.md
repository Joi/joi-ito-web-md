![nohs](http://joi.ito.com/images2/nohs.gif)I was excited when [I got my entry in the Internet Movie Database](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1385567/). I was thinking about how vain it was to be excited by this. It felt like being in some sort of elite [Orkut](http://www.orkut.com/). Just like Orkut, there was a "click here to add photo".

\*click\*
> $35 - Submit a Person's Headshot or a Film's Poster  
> *Replace the "no headshot" or "no poster" icon on their main page with a headshot/poster or change the current headshot/poster to a new one.*

$10 - Submit a Gallery Photo for a Film or Person  
*Add an image to your film's "studio stills" gallery or your personal "publicity photos" portfolio.*\*click\*
> **Why Do I Have To Pay?**

When you use this service you get to make sure the image **you** want is on the first page people see when they look you up or look up your film, and/or that there are images **you** have chosen in the photo gallery.

Without this service, you leave **all** the decisions of what is used, when it is used, and **if** it is used, entirely up to fate and our editors.

There are many factors that make it just too expensive for us to provide this service for free, so we have to charge you for it or not provide it at all.Ahh, the business model. ;-)
