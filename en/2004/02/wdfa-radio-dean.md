[WDFA - Radio Dean for America](http://radio.deanforamerica.com/)

Lots of stuff going on at the Dean campaign, but the Net team just keeps chugging along. [Zack](http://zacker.typepad.com/) has been working on the idea of "[happenings](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/02/16/lets_call_it_a_happening.html)" for the Dean Campaign, combining chat and Internet radio. They just did the first trial run and it was great. Anyone who has any thoughts or ideas, please contact Zack directly.
