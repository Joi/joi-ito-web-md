[asianmediawatch.net](http://www.asianmediawatch.net/) has started [a campaign](http://www.lost-in-racism.org/) to petition the movie industry to vote against "Lost In Translation" for the Academy Awards.

[My sister blogs about the negative depictions of Japanese in "Lost in Translation"](http://www.chanpon.org/archives/2004/02/07/totally_lost_in_translation.html). She links to a [UK Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1130137,00.html) and [New York Times article](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F2081EFE355A0C778CDDA80894DC404482) that point out similar issues with the movie.

When I first saw the movie, I thought it was funny. After reading the articles and the asianmediawatch site and thinking about how much influence Hollywood has on the way the world views cultures, I can see their point.
