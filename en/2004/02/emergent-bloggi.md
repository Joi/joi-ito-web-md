[![photo_library_3208](http://joi.ito.com/images2/photo_library_3208-tm.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/images2/photo_library_3208.jpg)Yesterday, [Jeff Jarvis](http://www.buzzmachine.com/) introduced us to the Iranian blogger, Pedram Moallemian. Pedram blogs at  [the eyeranian](http://eyeranian.net/). He is one of the outspoken Iranians who blogs in English and help us understand what's going on on the incredible number of Persian blogs. He explain that the Persian blogs can be traced to the short explanation written by Hoder at [Hoder.com](http://www.hoder.com/) explaining how to use [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/) in Persian. There are now over 100,000 Persian blogs. Most of the blogs are about politics and sex as well as other things like poetry. The suppression of free speech in Iran is one of the explanations for the number of Persian blogs, but the notion that one short page of Persian documentation for Blogger starting this incredible trend is also very important. Many countries and languages probably just need a small seed to create an emergent cascade of blogging adoption.

[Jeff writes about an arrested Iranian blogger](http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2003_12.html#005497) who was recently freed. Great post with links to other interesting posts about Iranian blogging.
