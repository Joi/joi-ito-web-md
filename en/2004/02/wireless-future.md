I'll be in Austin, Texas in March (13-16) for a conference called [Wireless Future](http://www.wirelessfuture.org), actually a "mini-conference" that's part of South by Southwest Interactive. I think I'm on two panels. According to Jon Lebkowsky, who's one of the organizers, the conference focuses on developers, entrepreneurs, and creative thinkers who're interested in wireless technology and mobility. The program includes major presentations by Howard Rheingold (the keynote, called "Mobile Communication, Pervasive Computing, and Collective Action") and Kevin Werbach (the opening presentation, called "The Open Spectrum Revolution"). Other presenters include Cory Doctorow, Dewayne Henricks, David Weinberger, David Isenberg, Dave Hughes, and Justin Hall. We're also throwing a big EFF/Creative Commons party on March 15.

I need to figure out how to blog about upcoming conferences in an organized way. I wonder if I should have a rotating banner in the sidebar. Do you think that putting them in on my [travel page](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/JoiTravel) is enough?
