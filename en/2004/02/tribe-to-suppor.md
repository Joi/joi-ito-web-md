I just heard from Paul Martino, the CTO and Founder of [Tribe.net](http://www.tribe.net/), that they were working on [FOAF](http://www.foaf-project.org/) and RSS support for Tribe. Cool. There are going to be a lot of issues such as privacy, but I think that having companies like Tribe seriously working on FOAF will bring these issues front and center and make some of these theoretical discussions very concrete and productive.
