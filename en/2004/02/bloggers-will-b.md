> I'm trying to encourage Iranian blogger to go out tomorrow, the election day, and report what they see and hear in their city and blog it. I also plan to gather all posts related to it in one place either in my own [Persian blog](http://i.hoder.com) or in [Sobhaneh](http://sobhaneh.com), the collective news blog.
>
> I also consider a place in [iranFilter](http://iranfilter.com) for those Iranian who know English to provide translations the reports that are gathered in Persian.
>
> This can be the 9/11 for Persian blogosphere. It's the first event that potentially engages every body in every city in Iran and blogs can play a huge role in reporting the news, rumors, and all those things that traditional journalists usually miss.
>
> Iranian bloggers do not vote tomorrow, but the blog.
>
> Update: [special page on iranFilter](http://iranfilter.com/link.php/765) is now set up and it's ready for Persian bloggers' covereage on the election day. Please help us by translating whatever you find interesting in Persian sources into English.

A very important day for Iran and a chance for blogs to make a difference.
