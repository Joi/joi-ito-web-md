I'll be giving a plenary keynote at [MILIA](http://www.milia.com/App/homepage.cfm?appname=100218&moduleID=301&LinkID=12057&campaignid=75&iUserCampaignID=1031241) in Cannes, France on Thursday, April 1 at 9:30 AM. The title of the talk will be "Mobile Lifestyles" but, I'll build on the [presentation at I gave at the Sony Open Forum](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/SonyOpenForumSpeech04) and add some stuff about mobility. I'll be in Canne from March 31-April 3. If you're going to MILIA this year, let me know.
