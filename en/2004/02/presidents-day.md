Friends of mine who have been waiting for a long time were finally married as [San Francisco allowed same-sex marriages](http://www.kesq.com/Global/story.asp?S=1646243&nav=9qrxKq9d). It was a day of joy. We drove by City Hall here and saw a huge line of people waiting to get married. This is a great thing. Dan Gillmor has sparked an interesting discussion about the legal ramifications of the Mayor's decision and Lawrence Lessig comments on this.

The Mayor of San Francisco has [decided](http://www.ci.sf.ca.us/site/mayor_page.asp?id=22778) that a state law is unconstitutional under the state constitution, and has therefore ordered city clerks to disobey the law and obey the constitution. This [troubles](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001802.shtml) my friend Dan Gillmor, who on last count was right about everything else. And it is an action by a mayor, who on last count was wrong about a bunch of very important things. So who’s right now? I try to answer that in the extended essay that follows.
