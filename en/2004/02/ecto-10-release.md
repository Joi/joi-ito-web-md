[Version 1.0 of ecto, the blogging client for Mac OS X has just been released](http://www.kung-foo.tv/blog/archives/000758.php). It was written by Adriaan Tijsseling who works for me.

*What "version 1.0" means is that you can now **pay real money for it**.*

*PS In case you were wondering, this is a shameless plug.*
