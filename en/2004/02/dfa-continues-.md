Jim Moore blogs about the lessons that DeanforAmerica has learned and how it continues to evolve. He gives the example of MoveOn.org which started as a movement to "move on" from the Clinton impeachment, then broadened its mission to counter the selling of the Iraq war, and now is purchasing ads to get Americans to think. Obviously, Jim and everyone at DFA is still hoping for a Howard Dean victory, but Jim also muses about the idea of DFA continuing to gain momentum and power.

DeanforAmerica will have powerful mission in American politics.  DFA will work out new and effective mechanisms for citizen invovlement.  
[...]  
But win or lose in any particular struggle, we have power.   This is the deepest lesson of MoveOn--win or lose in the Clinton impeachment, MoveOn had and has power.
