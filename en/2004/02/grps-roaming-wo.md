I spent last month so excited by my Nokia 6600. Land in a random city, flip open my PowerBook, click, "connect" and I was immediately online via bluetooth, gprs and my T-Mobile roaming. Internet everywhere. It was sooo cool... until I got my bill. $3500 for one month of mobile abandon. At $3500 / month, I would say that it works, "technically" but is totally unacceptable socially and economically. It's like having a PowerBook stolen from the carriers and being beaten over the head with the stupid stick. It reminds me of the "good old days" of x.25. What's the point of broadband wireless unless people can afford it. This trip I'm hunting down the free wifi and only using grps when absolutely necessary.

NOTE TO CARRIERS: Make gprs cheap, flat fee and with free roaming or else... or else... you suck and I'm going to take my marbles and go play on 802.11.

UPDATE: I just got a Sonera account so I don't have to roam in Finland. It's about $20 for up to 100MB.
