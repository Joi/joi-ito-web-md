I will be moderating a panel at [ETech](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/) at 2:45pm on Feb 10 called "[Untethering the Social Network or What Happens to Social Networks in the Untethered Wilds?](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2004/view/e_sess/4865)" The panelists are danah, Scott, Mimi and Howard.

It should be one of the less geeky panels at this geek-a-thon.

And yes... Mimi is my sister and Scott is my brother-in-law. This is what happens when you talk about work at home too much. This is the first time my sister and I will be on a panel together.

> Users, not vendors, create communications revolutions, and
> the untethering of social networks from desktops promises a user-generated
> revolution over the coming decade as profound as the Internet revolution
> of the 1990s and PC revolution of the 1980s. This panel addresses how
> the coordinated actions of diverse connected users challenge fixed visions
> of technology deployment, particularly as social software migrates from
> the desktop into the mobile settings navigated by handhelds. We will
> discuss how undisciplined behaviors and places push back on models of
> social software and how this can and should affect technological
> development. We will consider the role of social networks in the
> development of and participation in mobile technology. Case studies used
> in this conversation include pervasive gaming, media mixes, mobile
> texting, and mobile blogging. This panel presents a good opportunity
> to discuss the role of social research in technology development.
