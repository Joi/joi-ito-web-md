I'm a Nominating Judge in [The Webby Awards](http://www.webbyawards.com/main/) [Community Category](http://www.webbyawards.com/main/webby_awards/nominees.html#community). Help me out by [suggesting cool community sites](http://www.webbyawards.com/outreach.html?id=u%9B%C6%BF%C1%84YA).
> Community: Sites creating and facilitating online community, connectedness and/or communication around shared interests. These sites can target either a broad-based or niche audience.

Please use this [web form](http://www.webbyawards.com/outreach.html?id=u%9B%C6%BF%C1%84YA) to submit your suggestions to me.
