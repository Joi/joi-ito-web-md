Christian is "Mr. UI" of Nokia. He gave me this cool application yesterday.

> Pertti Korhonen, Nokia’s new CTO introduced PhotoBlog for Series 60 in his keynote at ETech in San Diego. This application proof-of-concept is supporting the Atom API enabling users to post to leading blog platforms. The application was developed by [Futurice](http://www.futurice.fi/), who is developing a Photblog platform.

This lets you post photos to your [TypePad](https://www.typepad.com/t/app/home) (or any other Atom API compliant) photo album directly from the phone without going through email.
