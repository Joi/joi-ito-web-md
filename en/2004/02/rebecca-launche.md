[Rebecca](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/techjournalism/), from CNN, who is now at Harvard on sabattical, has just launched a [new blog about North Korea](http://www.NKzone.org/). It's an cool experiment in blogging/journalism by someone who has a lot of on-the-ground experience covering difficult topics like this.
> This is an experiment in interactive, participatory journalism. And in the new age of internet web-blogging, we are ALL journalists.

NKzone is NOT a conventional news or information website. Our members will build NKzone collectively with unique, personal, and (whenever possible) first-hand insights about the world's most mysterious country. Please approach this site not as a "viewer" or "reader", but as a "participant" and "contributor." NKzone is non-partisan. It seeks to generate interest and debate about North Korea. It seeks to include many clashing views. It is not advocating a particular cause, other than the desire that people be better informed about North Korea.
