As a former student, I sure wish I had had [RateMyTeachers.com](http://ratemyteachers.com/index.jsp) (via [Seb](http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/2004/01/29.html#a1430)) when I was in school. I would have had a lot to say and I would have felt justified. Maybe I wouldn't have had to start our underground newspaper. On the other hand, I can see how this might be abused. There are some thoughtful comments from many people about the "[Adopt A Reporter](http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2004/01/10/reporter_adopt.html)" idea over on PressThink. This is not a new issue, but an old issue that continues to accelerate. [As Loic points out](http://www.u-blog.net/loic/note/57163), blogging helps you manage your own identity instead of leaving it up to others. Having said that, any notion that you can "control" your identity is a myth.

Over at [Chanpon](http://www.chanpon.org/), someone blogged about a teacher from my high school who passed away. Some students posted some allegations in the comments. Obviously, since the teacher was dead, he couldn't defend himself. On the other hand, the students obviously felt justified and there are very few opportunities for students to speak up about their teachers. [We ended up removing the entry and the comments](http://www.chanpon.org/archives/2004/01/25/editorial_decision.html). It was a very difficult decision, but we did what we thought was right. Blogs and other forms of publishing come with a great deal of responsibility and it is very difficult to judge what is right and wrong. That is why we need to think about justice and [how we can make the institution of blogs and the Internet just](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/01/06/are_blogs_just.html). The technology influences what we can do and how people use it. Having said that, just as with politicians, we get what we deserve. Unless we have a strong sense of justice and speak up, we'll end up with bad technologies in the same way we end up with bad politicians.
