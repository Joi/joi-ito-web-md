At the Emerging Tech conference, more than one person noted the striking resemblance between [Ethan Zuckerman](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/ethan/) and [Benjamin Franklin](http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/index.htm). Coincidence? You decide.A lot of the people working on emergent democracy look founding fatherish. I wonder if you [start looking](http://joi.typepad.com/photos/etech2004/photo_library_2900.html) [like a founding father](http://joi.typepad.com/photos/etech2004/photo_library_2901.html) after you start pondering or whether looking in the mirror each day causes you to go down the "pondering about democracy" path. Where does that put me?
