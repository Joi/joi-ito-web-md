I finally met someone who went on dates with three people she met on [Orkut](http://www.orkut.com/Home.aspx). So far so good she reports.
> Orkut is supplying me with a life so, via orkut, I got comped into Etech, I got a meeting with VCs, 3 dates had, three arranged, and lots of people have walked up to me and said, "oh! hi!"
