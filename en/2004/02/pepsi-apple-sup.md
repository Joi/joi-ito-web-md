[A great parody of the Pepsi / Apple Superbowl commercial.](http://nmc.siu.edu/~pepsi/) (Thanks RS!)

[You can see the original Pepsi / iTunes ad here.](http://www.ifilm.com/?sctn=collections&pg=superbowl2004) (Thanks Shawn!)

[It's also on the Apple site.](http://www.apple.com/itunes/pepsi/ads/)

I guess, as Boris says, it's not so much a parody as what they really wanted to say, but couldn't. Those kids probably got paid more to do the ad than they paid the RIAA. The RIAA is getting so stupid that it's getting cool to make fun of them. Sounds like the beginning of the end when your business involves being cool.
