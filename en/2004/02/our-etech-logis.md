I received a request to help figure out a way to organize people hooking up at ETech. I set up a [wiki page for that](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/EtechHookUp). I've posted my schedule. Feel free to add your stuff and post things. I guess we could have used to [ETech Wiki](http://wiki.oreillynet.com/etech/view?HomePage), but I wasn't sure what was appropriate behavior there. If there is already such a page set up, let me know and I will refactor.
In particular, I'd like to know how the [participant session](http://wiki.oreillynet.com/etech/pub?ParticipantSessions) date/times are supposed to be decided. Does anyone know?
Also, people planning parties, please post them on [the wiki](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/EtechHookUp) if possible.
There are a bazilion things going on at one time which is going to be great fun, but a logistical challenge. ;-)
