Arrived at [ETech](http://conferences.oreilly.com/etech/). Lots of people and not enough time to blog. The Internet in my room isn't working, but hopefully, they'll fix it today. Today is the Digital Democracy Teach-In. Should be fun. I'll try to post notes.

A few one liners I scribbled in my notebook:

"I wanted to be a revolutionary, but all I got was this stupid blog."

"I'm not an academic, but I play one on my blog."
