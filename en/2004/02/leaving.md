I was going to write "hitting the road now, see you on the other side," but I realized that I'm going to be flying, not hitting the road, and I'll probably see you a few times along the way. Leaving on a trip is really not an important event anymore except that the likelihood that something bad is going to happen to you increases for a period of time.

Anyway, for those of you who are going to [ETech](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etcon/), see you you face to face soon.
