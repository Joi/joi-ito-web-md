I knew I would not be able to compete with the other bloggers in covering the content of [ETech](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/) so I focused on photos. I've finally uploaded most of the decent photos [here](http://joi.typepad.com/photos/etech2004/). I took the photos with my [Canon 300D](http://joi.typepad.com/stuff/2003/12/switching_to_ca.html). I used a 55-200mm telephoto zoom lens which helped me be more invasive and catch people off-guard. It looks more like a collection of snapshots of my friends than anything resembling photojournalism. For some real photojournalism, take a look at the [World Press Photo awards](http://www.worldpressphoto.nl/index.jsp).
