10,000,000 people doing *radio taiso*

One of the participants of [Fat Club](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/08/25/fat_club_redux.html) uploaded an mp3 of *radio taiso* (morning radio exercise show) and I just set it to my alarm clock sound. *radio taiso* was banned by the US Occupation after WWII along with *shogi* (Japanese chess), all martial arts and a bunch of other things that were considered militaristic. I remember hearing a story on the radio that the original *radio taiso* came from the US. When life insurance just started as a business in the US, there was an uproar about "betting on people's lives." As part of a PR campaign, the life insurance companies started broadcasting exercise programs on the radio to make people more healthy. This culture migrated to Japan where now every morning millions of people exercise to *radio taiso*...

Here is the [mp3 of chorus 1 of *radio taiso*](http://joi.ito.com/music/RadioTaisoDaiIchi.mp3).

*Does anyone know if this story about the US insurance companies is true or not?*

The [Kampo home page](http://www.kampo.japanpost.jp/kenkou/radio/taisou.html) has little animations like the one above and a full explanation (in Japanese) on how to do these exercises properly.
