[Cryptome](http://cryptome.org/) is one of my primary sources of documents that get released to the public through a variety of sources. I link to it quite often from my blog. [ABC News questions](http://abcnews.go.com/sections/WNT/US/internet_sensitive_info_040812-1.html) the value of the public's right to know, vs the risk of "helping the enemy." I have a feeling that terrorists are pretty good at using the Internet and probably already have access to most of the stuff on Cryptome. I think that it could be argued that they are helping terrorists by making the information so easy to find, but I personally think that Cryptome and other sites like it are important in fighting against the natural tendency to hide behind secrecy.
