Since I can't get onto the GW site, I guess I have to settle for the [NROjr.gov](http://www.nrojr.gov/NROjr/index.htm) site. The NRO?

> National Reconnaissance Office
>
> The NRO designs, builds and operates the nation's [reconnaissance satellites](http://www.nro.gov/satpics.html). NRO products, provided to an expanding list of customers like the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Department of Defense (DoD), can warn of potential trouble spots around the world, help plan military operations, and monitor the environment.
>
> As part of the 14-member [Intelligence Community](http://www.intelligence.gov/), the NRO plays a primary role in achieving information superiority for the U. S. Government and Armed Forces.

So what is [NROjr](http://www.nrojr.gov/NROjr/index.htm)? It's a "A fun site to engage children in the wonders of science, math and space in a fun and interactive manner," brought to you by the NRO. (Make sure you have your sound turned on to enjoy the full experience. And all this time I thought Ernie actually worked for Sesame Street... although I guess he was recently heard [singing Orkutworld](http://joi.ito.com/music/orkutworld.mp3).)
