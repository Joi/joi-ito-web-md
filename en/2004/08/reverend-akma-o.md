[Reverend AKMA has an interesting post](http://akma.disseminary.org/archives/001507.html) on the [front-page story](http://insider.washingtontimes.com/articles/normal.php?StoryID=20040817-011449-2970r) claim that someone has discovered the cave of John the Baptist and why he isn't into archaeology anymore.

> This story reflects several problematic tendencies in the popular (biblical) archaeological market. We get their textual siblings over in literary historiography, so I’m not casting stones only at the other interpreters. But there have been heaps of hermits (I just spent way too much time trying to devise a collective noun for anchorites) in the Judean wilderness about whom we know absolutely nothing. We happen to know a little about one of them: John. So when an archaeologist finds a hermit’s cave that fits what we might expect John’s cave to have looked like, someone draws the inference that it actually was John’s cave.

Go AKMA! The image of heaps of hermits reminds me a bit of [Life of Brian](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079470/). ;-)
