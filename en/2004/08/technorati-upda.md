[Dave has posted an update on the situation at Technorati](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000370.html). Quick summary: Fixed a bunch of things to get the CNN thing done on time, but broke some other things in the process. We're very sorry. Apologies also for being unresponsive. Thank you very much for your feedback and patience and we'll try harder to address the issues.
