[David Weinberger video blogs](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002909.html) a reply to [Charles Cooper's article](http://news.com.com/2010-1028-5289475.html?tag=nefd.acpro) at CNET.

Charles Cooper criticizes the credentialed DNC bloggers as bad journalists and David responds. If the text of his response had been in his post, I might not have watched the video, but after watching the video, I realized that it was worth it. I keep forgetting how funny David is in full motion. ;-)

I made a [BitTorrent](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?BitTorrent) torrent of the 11MB Quicktime version of the post. [The torrent is here.](/torrents/conventionblog.torrent) I'm still trying to debug my tracker so I'd appreciate comments about any success or failure you have with this torrent. Thanks!
