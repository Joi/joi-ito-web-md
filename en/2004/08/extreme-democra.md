[![edlogo](http://joi.ito.com/images/edlogo.jpg)](http://extremedemocracy.com/)  
*Extreme Democracy* is a book being edited by [Jon Lebkowsky](http://www.weblogsky.com/) and [Mitch Ratcliffe](http://www.ratcliffeblog.com/). They've just put the [book online in a blog format](http://extremedemocracy.com/). The book will included a version of my [Emergent Democracy paper edited by Jon](http://joi.ito.com/static/emergentdemocracy.html). I really need to write another version of this paper that incorporates all of the new stuff and feedback that I've received...

[Adina](http://alevin.com/weblog/) has put up [a wiki page with additional thoughts on the book](http://alevin.com/cgi-bin/kwiki/index.cgi?ModelingEmergentDemocracy).
