I did an [interview for NPR's summer reading series](http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=3835620) where we are supposed to talk about books to read over the summer. I ended up talking mostly about blogs. ;-) It's about a month old.

What do YOU recommend we read this summer?

UPDATE: Here are my notes on [Orientalism by Edward Said](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/05/09/orientalism_by_edward_w_said.html), thoughts after reading [Science In Action by Bruno Latour](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/08/31/science_in_action_bruno_latour.html), and my [short review of We the Media by Dan Gillmor](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/05/17/we_the_media_by_dan_gillmor.html).
