Ooops. Why is it that I don't trust them when they say stuff like, "In the aftermath of the accident, no evacuation order was given to residents living near the plant, and city official Nobutake Masaki denied there was any danger to the surrounding area." [This is probably because they lie.](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/09/03/tepco_lied_over_cracks_at_nuke_plants.html) At least some people are [brave enough to blow the whistle](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/02/08/contacted_by_whistlerblower_on_tepco_nuclear_reactor_coverup.html).
