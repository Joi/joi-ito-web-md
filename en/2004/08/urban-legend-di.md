Mizuka just asked me if I had heard about some guy who was busted for making tons of money trading stocks who claims to be a time-traveler. The story was that he would show them the time-machine if they let him go. She said her Japanese friends were talking about it. I laughed and checked Google News with an assortment of keywords with no results. I wandered over to [#joiito](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?IrcChannel). Soon enough nichlas came up with a [link to a WWN article from March, 2003](http://tv.yahoo.com/news/wwn/20030319/104808600007.html) about the story. Just as I was wondering if this was something to blog about, KevinMarks page-slapped us with the [snopes.com entry from April 2003 debunking the story](http://www.snopes.com/humor/iftrue/insider.htm).

I would really love to see the path that this silly story took over the last 1 1/2 years to get from WWN to me via the Japanese girls gossip network.
