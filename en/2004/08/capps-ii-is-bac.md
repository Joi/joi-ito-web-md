The [US Transporation Security Administration (TSA) announced](http://www.tsa.gov/public/display?theme=44&content=09000519800c6c77&print=yes) that [CAPPS II](http://www.eff.org/Privacy/cappsii/background.php), the controversial passenger profiling system is back looking a bit more shy and sporting a new name, "Secure Flight." It still sounds bad and they'll start testing it within the next 30-60 days.
