The folks at [Ars Electronica](http://www.aec.at/en/index.asp) have translated a shortened version of [Jon Lebkowsky's edited version](http://www.extremedemocracy.com/archives/2004/08/chapter_1_emerg.html) of my Emergent Democracy [paper into German](http://joi.ito.com/static/emergent_democracy_de.pdf). It will appear in this year's book for Ars Electronica. Thanks for coordinating this Ingrid and thanks for the translation Susanne!
