It's been nice to spend time at home, but I'm off again today to Wasatch, Utah to a retreat and then to San Francisco for a short visit. It's the summer *obon* season so the airport's probably pretty busy today. So I may check again at the airport, but if not, see you on the other side.

I'm going to end up in the mountains in Wasatch for a few days so depending on the connectivity, you may not hear from me for a few days...

UPDATE: I'm at the United lounge in Narita and the wifi here is free now (yay!) but they are blocking the ports for IRC and MSN Messenger. (boo!)
