"The New York Times is my blog" Markoff just IMed me with this funny [comment from Slashdot](http://books.slashdot.org/books/04/08/03/0858230.shtml?tid=188&tid=192) about Dan Gillmor's [We the Media](http://wethemedia.oreilly.com/). I would have gotten more defensive if it weren't so funny.

Anyway, keep laughing Markoff. Just you wait and see. ;-)

*Yes... I did photoshop out the end of his AIM nickname.*
