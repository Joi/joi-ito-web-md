[ecto](http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/), the blogging client developed by [Adriaan](http://blog.kung-foo.tv/) at my company Kula has just released the beta of the next version which has "What You See Is Almost What You Get" (wysiawyg). This means that you can now do things like drag, drop, resize images into posts. You can also create links, change font information and lots of other stuff without looking at or dealing with html. ([More info on the ecto blog](http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/archives/001092.php).) ecto 2.0 has a bunch of other cool features. Adriaan says it should be ready for general release of the OS X version in about two weeks. Until then... gloat.. gloat...
