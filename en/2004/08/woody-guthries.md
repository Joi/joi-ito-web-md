It has already been widely reported that music publisher Ludlow Music has threatened copyright litigation against [JibJab](http://www.jibjab.com/) for their animation "This Land" which uses Woody Guthrie's "This Land is Your Land." [Corante](http://www.corante.com/importance/archives/005482.php), [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/08/06/cathy_guthries_opini.html) and [NPR](http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=3810407) report that the kids like [JibJab](http://www.jibjab.com/). [Wendy Seltzer makes an interesting point](http://www.corante.com/copyfight/archives/005570.html) that when Congress passed the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, they said it was "for the children." Wendy says, "It's worth remembering, again, that artists and copyright holders aren't always the same people."
