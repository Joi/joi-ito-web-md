[David Weinberger blogs about George Bush denouncing 527 groups](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002999.html). David links to Roji pointing out that this is a [serious flip-flop](http://www.rojisan.com/blog/2004/08/bush_actually_did_oppose_mccainfeingold_before_he_signed_it.html) from his original position.

David's point is that on the one hand, the 527 groups represent a way to buy influence. On the other hand, limiting the ability for a 527 group to be formed and express a point of view is limiting free speech.

I think the reason we have this conflict is the nature of media today. It shouldn't cost millions of dollars to get your message out; the system should be transparent enough so we know who is behind those messages; and most importantly, those messages should spark dialog and lies and stupidity should be smacked down as fast as urban legends on [snopes](http://www.snopes.com/). The problem with allowing money to buy "free speech" is that the speech is asymmetrical and not deliberative. ...yet.
