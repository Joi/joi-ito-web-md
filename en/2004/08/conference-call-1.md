I have my PowerBook on my [insTand](http://joi.typepad.com/stuff/2004/01/instand_1.html) next to my bed with a clock screen saver alarm clock. Usually, I wake up before my alarm goes off and wake up the computer instead. As soon as my status on my IM clients goes from idle to available, I get a little flurry of requests for contact. "Did you see my email?" "When can we talk?" "Don't forget our conference call coming up." "We're on a conference call right now you might want to join." I queue up these real-time requests like some sort of air traffic controller, put on my headset hooked up to my Vonage phone and get started. Today, I started the morning with an conference call on the fly with a few people on a one of the many [free conference](http://www.freeconference.com/) call bridges. During the call, I got an IM that I might want to drop into another conference call in progress. After my first call, I joined the second conference call which was already well on its way. I got the URL of the wiki page of the agenda and notes via IM, scanned them, and made a few comments. Then I was off again to my next call which I had queued with someone on [IRC](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?ircchannel).

My question is, am I a weirdo or an edge case for how people will work once we all have IM and voice and conference calls are free.
