[UPI via The Washington Times](http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20040823-123020-7366r.htm) reports that the Weather Underground are planning some action during the RNC. UPI says:
> United Press International
>
> "These people are trained in kidnapping techniques, bombmaking and building improvised munitions," the source said. "They're very bad people..."

Someone who asked not to be named emailed me and says that they heard that, "it's planned on being a nonviolent action. Something about leaflets and random covert protesters." If this is indeed the case, there is a pretty high likelihood of some really wound up police running into some pretty innocent people. If you are at risk of looking like a risk to the police, make sure you read about your rights. ([344k ZIPped PDF on cryptome.org](http://cryptome.org/rnc-rights.zip)) *via Boing Boing*

> UPDATE: An anonymous tipster sez "this pamphlet was done by the wonderful Katya Komisaruk over at the [Just Cause Law Collective](http://www.lawcollective.org/). At her site, lawcollective.org, there's the pamphlet and tons of other info about how to not lose your rights when dealing with the po. (Including Komsiaruk's book, set up much like the pamphlet, 'Beat the Heat.' Komisaruk applied and was accepted to Harvard Law School while in federal prison for anti-nuke demonstrations. She went to HLS while on parole and graduated with honors. Now she's one of the most active anarchist lawyers in the U.S."

UPDATE: Anonymous old media journalist who thinks the UPI story is bunk: "my theory is that the republicans are going to have their own anarchists there a la the [reichstag fire](http://www.weyrich.com/political_issues/reichstag_fire.html)...."
