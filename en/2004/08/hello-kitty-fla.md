Doom 3 has only just come out and already the modders are revving up their engines. My favorite so far: a Hello Kitty flashlight mod that makes your gun's built-in light cast a kawaii beam on the objects it alights upon. [Link](http://the.taoofmac.com/space/blog/2004-08-08)

(*via [Oblomovka](http://www.oblomovka.com)*)Doom modder culture has become truly sophisticated. ;-) How very Boing Boing.
