The AP reports that the [IOC bars athletes, coaches from writing first-hand accounts](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5763823/) This reminds me of the (now defunct) rule that companies couldn't report earnings and other reports on the Internet until after newspapers had time to print. This was supposed prevent an "unfair advantage" for people who use the Internet. Protecting traditional journalists by muzzling first-hand reports from athletes and coaches is so wrong and stupid.
