I've never actually picked up and read [The New York Post](http://www.nypost.com/). I first heard about it when [their front page story was: "Kerry's Choice, Dem picks Gephardt as VP candidate"](http://money.cnn.com/2004/07/06/news/newsmakers/ebay_gephardt/) and now this.

> Reader [Mike Harris](http://del.icio.us/WCityMike) says, "The New York Post is [reporting](http://www.nypost.com/news/regionalnews/29532.htm) that it was spray paint, instead of a water-soluble chalk mixture. Users might want to ask that they correct their reporting. The online edition/news editor's name is Chris Shaw, at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)."

I wonder where they get their facts?
