I [blogged earlier](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/08/16/ebay_acquires_minority_interest_in_craigslist.html) about the sale of 25% of the stock of Craigslist to eBay. Out of context, some people might not understand why this requires explaining or someone with a casual understanding might think Craig sold out. Here's some more context. (And no, Craig has not "sold out".)

Craig is a very unique individual and this interview and [his site](http://www.craigslist.org/) are a testament to that. [In March, on the way to SXSW, I was with a group which had an airline nightmare at SFO.](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/03/17/03_for_mesa_airlines.html) Craig negotiated with the extremely unhelpful Mesa Airlines for the whole group of us and was amazingly effective. I was moved by how he insisted that we were a group and was not willing to settle for anything that left anyone behind.

> Wired Magazine ran an interview this month with Craig Newmark, the founder of Craigslist and an all-round mensch:

> Google's touchy-feely corporate mantra is "Don't be evil." What's yours?
>
> Give people a break.
>
> A break from what?
>
> A break from how difficult our lives are. It's like, if you're walking out of your apartment building and somebody is coming the other way with an armful of groceries, you hold the door. It feels good - it's the neighborly thing to do. And our species survives by cooperating.
>
> What poses the major threat to that survival?
>
> Kleptocrats and sociopathic organizations that have the almighty dollar as their only goal.
