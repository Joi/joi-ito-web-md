I'm getting some blow-by-blow commentary from [Mitch](http://www.ratcliffeblog.com/) via IM right now and I can understand David's feelings.

> Mitch: pretty wretched talk -- it is ugly in several dimensions, suggesting anyone who disagrees with Bush is an appeaser  
> Mitch: he literally just said "either you are with us or with the terrorists"  
> Mitch: and followed by comparing Bush to Churchill  
> Mitch: Rudy is sure he's Churchillian

Regarding David's post, Mitch says, "too many years as a reporter -- I can watch anything."
