Pierre Omidyar the founder of eBay has a new project called the [Omidyar Network](http://www.omidyar.net/). They just invested in [SocialText](http://www.socialtext.com/), a wiki company that I've invested in and am on the board of. [Pierre blogs](http://pierre.typepad.com/pierre/2004/08/what_ive_been_u.html) about the Omidyar network and the investment in Socialtext. If you have heard of the Omidyar Network:

We exist for one single purpose:  
So that more and more people discover their own  
power to make good things happen.

We are actively building a network of participants  
because we know we can't do this alone.Other investors in this Series A funding include Reid Hoffman, Mark Pincus and Jun Makihara. [Full story on Socialtext page](http://www.socialtext.com/weblog/040823seriesa.html). Congrats and thanks to all involved.
