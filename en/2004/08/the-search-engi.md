I remember when I was Chairman of [Infoseek Japan](http://www.infoseek.co.jp/), I would get a weekly list of the top 100 search words. I remember loving this list. You could see watch trends and stuff, but mostly it made you realize just how sick people were. When I was around, the only US search term that beat adult content phrases was "Olympics" and the only Japanese query was "Tamagocchi" when it was all the rage.

Now uber-gadget-hacker Phillip Torrone has brought this experience to the street via the [Search Engline Belt Buckle](http://www.engadget.com/entry/6833839062762584/). It uses the [SearchSpy](http://www.dogpile.com/info.dogpl/searchspy/results.htm?fci=1?filter=0&qcat=web) service which shows real search queries and is provided by [Dogpile](http://www.dogpile.com/), the metasearch engine.

I suppose this is slightly more useful than an RSS feed of my weight, but definitely harder to build.
