[Adam Curry](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/) samples a portion of [Halley's](http://halleyscomment.blogspot.com/2004/08/geek-stud-not.html) interview with me on [Memory Lane](http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail180.html) on his [Daily Source Code Aug 17 2004](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/categories/dailySourceCode/2004/08/17.html#a6365) - [(1.2MB mp3 of relevant section)](http://joi.ito.com/images/dailysourcesnip.mp3). I'm talking about how I showed the chairman of NHK (Japan's public broadcast network) a video that I downloaded from Adam Curry's MTV.COM. I think this was around 1994 or 1995... It was one of the few video files on the net at the time. I used to show this video all the time and I told this to Adam when I met him at Bloggercon. He said he wanted a copy of the video and I thought I might have it around, but I looked and I don't have it. Sorry Adam! Does anyone else have it? It's a bit of Internet nostalgia and history that would be fun to have. Unfortunately, I think this predates [archive.org](http://www.archive.org/).
