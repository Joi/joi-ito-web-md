I know people are tired of this story, but this post gives us some closure on the discussion in my previous [flippant post about the Hyote](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/07/21/its_just_a_lost_pet_hyena.html).

The Hyote, a magical mystery animal that's been running around central Maryland, has apparently been captured. (Previous post [here](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/07/21/hyote_mystery_contin.html).) Amazingly though, this Hyote--a male red fox with sarcoptic mange, according to veterinarians--is most likely the offspring of the larger animal caught on video last month. Once the baby Hyote is well again, animal control will release it back into the wild. [Link](http://www.thewbalchannel.com/news/3604238/detail.html) *(Thanks, Soupie!)*
