[Adina has a nice essay](http://alevin.com/weblog/archives/001482.html#001482) about why participants in what Benkler calls *commons-based peer production* are not necessarily communists. If you don't have time to read [Benkler's 80 page *Coase's Peguin* paper](http://www.yale.edu/yalelj/112/BenklerWEB.pdf), I suggest you read Adina's essay which picks up some important points that you don't get in the abstract.
