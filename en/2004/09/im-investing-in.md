Esther scooped me and [announced](http://weblog.edventure.com/blog/_archives/2004/9/25/149243.html) that she is investing in [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/). So am I. I haven't been blogging about flickr too much, even though I'm addicted because I wanted to wait to announce this first. I'm just a passive investor, but wanted to disclose this relationship.

You can see my photos on [my flickr photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/) page. You can even subscribe to it in [RSS 2.0](http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=35034362831@N01&format=rss_200) or [Atom](http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=35034362831@N01&format=atom_03). Remember to check out the [Tags page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/). There is also [my personal tags](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/tags/) page. Things have been getting very taggy around here ever since I started using [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/).

Thanks for the opportunity to invest Stewart and Caterina.
