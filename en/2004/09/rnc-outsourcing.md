[I reported back in September 2003](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/09/16/republicans_creating_jobs_in_india.html) that an Indian newspaper reported a local company receiving an outsourcing contract from the Republicans for fund-raising calls. The Republicans denied this at the time. [Dvorak has an update](http://www.dvorak.org/blog/index.php?p=354).

The Texas outfit may have actually got away with its outsourcing exercise if it had not been for the poor training given to Indian telemarketers who handled the job. Sources here said the India-based operation was exposed when one American who received a fund-raising phone call on behalf of the Republican Victory Committee wanted to know where the call was coming from.

“The Washington DC of Virginia,” the caller answered. Washington, the US capital, is actually in DC, short for District of Columbia, and Virginia is its neighbouring state.I personally have nothing against outsourcing to India, but it probably looks bad for the RNC.
