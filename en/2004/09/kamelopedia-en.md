[Kamelopedia](http://kamelopedia.de/), originally a German parody of [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/), has [launched in English](http://en.kamelopedia.de/). Kamelopedia uses the same [MediaWiki software](http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/) that Wikipedia uses, but it is a joke encyclopedia based on puns and mistakes. Wikipedia has an [english language description of Kamelopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamelopedia). I just signed up, but I'm not sure which is more fun... trying to be funny, or writing in the Wikipedia deadpan tone about something that is funny. (I'm working on this style on the [Stealth Disco article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_Disco).) There is also the [Wikipedia Bad jokes and other deleted nonsense page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bad_jokes_and_other_deleted_nonsense).
