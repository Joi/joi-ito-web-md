IBM History Flow visualization of the "Islam" article on Wikipedia.  
I think the gaps are where the page has been erased and restored.  
See the [IBM History Flow page](http://researchweb.watson.ibm.com/history/) for more details and examples.

I think this has been mentioned in the press already, but I confirmed with Jimmy Wales that a study done by IBM (The group that did the [history flow work](http://researchweb.watson.ibm.com/history/)) tried to measure how quickly vandalism on [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) was identified and corrected. They searched for pages where suddenly all of the content disappeared or a huge amount was deleted. They found that the median time for such a page to be restored was 5 minutes. This did not take into the account the process that where Wikipedians often refactor or move pages and redirect them which would show a similar behavior. So the median time is probably less than 5 minutes. In the context of our [discussion about Wikipedia authority](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/08/29/wikipedia_attacked_by_ignorant_reporter.html), I think this is quite an interesting and impressive statistic.
