> For more than a year, the music industry has held firm on its zero-tolerance position on online file swapping, suing 4,679 alleged digital pirates to drive its point home.
>
> But now, 16 high-profile artists, many of them signed to the same global music companies that have brought the lawsuits, are participating in a project that will allow music lovers to freely copy and trade some new songs without risking legal retaliation.
>
> Next month, songs by the Beastie Boys, David Byrne and 14 others will appear on a compilation CD whose contents are meant to be copied freely online, remixed or sampled by other artists for use in their own new recordings. "The Wired CD: Rip. Sample. Mash. Share." was compiled by the editors of Wired magazine, of San Francisco, as an experimental implementation of a new kind of intellectual-property license called Creative Commons. About 750,000 copies of the disc are to be distributed free with the magazine's November issue. The disc also will be handed out to audience members at a benefit concert by Mr. Byrne and others tomorrow night in New York.

The CD will include:

Beastie Boys - 'Now Get Busy'  
David Byrne - 'My Fair Lady'  
Zap Mama - 'Wadidyusay?'  
My Morning Jacket - 'One Big Holiday'  
Spoon - 'Revenge!'  
Gilberto Gil - 'Oslodum'  
Dan the Automator - 'Relaxation Spa Treatment'  
Le Tigre - 'Fake French'  
Paul Westerberg - 'Looking Up in Heaven'  
Cornelius - 'Wataridori 2'  
Matmos - 'Action at a Distance'

Thanks to Chris and everyone at Wired for pulling this together. See you tonight at the concert!
