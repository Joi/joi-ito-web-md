Today was my first day of school. The requirement for getting an university email, intranet and wifi account requires a course in [netiquette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netiquette). The course focused on "don't spread viruses." OK.

I showed up a few minutes late as Professor Takeuchi was talking about how tardiness would not be tolerated. (Sorry Professor Takeuchi!) Strike one. I sat in my student chair feeling very guilty.

Next was the session where we were going to get our accounts.

Instructor A: "So does everyone have have ICS IT Handbook?"

I didn't have one.

Me: "No. I didn't get one. Can I have one?"

Scarier instructor B: "Why don't you have one?"

Me: "I didn't get one. Where do we get one."

Scarier instructor B: "Sit down and share with someone." (scowl)

Me: "Umm.. OK."

So we were instructed on how to log in, change our password, etc. I finished a bit early and was messing around with my profiles. I noticed a place on the intranet where we could upload our picture. I started googling around for a good image to use when...

Scarier instructor B: "Are you following the instructor?"

I had clearly been profiled as a problem student by this point.

I turns out that there are only 3 DBA students and I was the only one attending today so I was put in another class. That's why I didn't have the handbook. Scarier instructor B didn't know this so I guess it's not her fault for scowling. But sitting in a classroom being scolded by instructors brought back a lot of memories. ;-) I'm going to have to get used to it and try to fit in a bit better... for now.
