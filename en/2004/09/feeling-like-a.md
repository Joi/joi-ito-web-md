Two years ago [I marched in protest against the Japan National ID](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/08/04/rally_against_the_national_id.html). Last year, after we failed, a few cities and prefectures resisted. Yokohama took the position that the bill was illegal because it required privacy protection and the privacy bill had not passed. They allowed citizens to opt out and an whopping 24% of their citizens opted out. Now that the privacy bill of the central government is in place, Yokohama is being forced to "normalize" with the central government. [Last year, I accepted an appoint to the Yokoyama personal information protection committee](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/04/28/meeting_with_mayor_nakada_of_yokohama_and_first_meeting_of_personal_information_protection_committee.html) which would oversee their integration of the national ID system with the hope that I could help them in their resistance. Today, almost a year after the first meeting, I spent the afternoon in what was basically a rubber stamp session. We voiced our opinions, but at this point there really wasn't much choice. These inquiry committee are constitutionally defined organs for people to interact with the law making process, but I felt more like a cog with a rubber stamp than a participant in a democracy.
