Yes. Yet another social networking site... I decided to play with this one for awhile before blogging it to make sure it was significantly different. I think it is. [Plazes](http://beta.plazes.com/) takes your IP address and tries to figure out where you are asks for the address of where you are and maps it to the MAC address of the router you are connected to. If you are in a new "plaze" you can register it by entering the address, uploading pictures, making comments. You can see who is online and where they are. You can see people by how far away they are from you. I imagine that once it gets going, most common hang outs will have lots of comments and pictures and you will be able to find people in your vicinity to hook up with. It's a bit like a laptop version of [dodgeball](http://dodgeball.com/social/index.php). I'm "Joi" on Plazes.

And in other YASNS news, I finally got my [wallop](http://mywallop.com/) (Microsoft Research's SNS) invitation. I'm "Joi" there as well.
