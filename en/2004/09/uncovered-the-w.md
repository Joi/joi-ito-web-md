> In a follow-up to the licensing of the [Outfoxed movie under a Creative Commons license](http://www.torrentocracy.com/blog/archives/2004/09/outfoxed_torren.shtml), Robert Greenwald has also agreed to release the interviews from his previous movie, [Uncovered: The War on Iraq](http://www.truthuncovered.com/) under the Creative Commons. The files can be downloaded directly (also available in higher quality format) from [archive.org](http://www.archive.org/movies/details-db.php?collection=election_2004&collectionid=uncovered_interviews), or you can join the torrent hosted on Torrentocracy.com at [uncovered\_interviews.torrent](http://www.torrentocracy.com/files/torrents/uncovered_interviews.torrent).

Yay! Thanks Gary! And hats off to Robert Greenwald for actually doing what [Moore talked about with F 9/11](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/07/05/moore_on_filesharing_of_f_911.html). I think that P2P and political documentaries is an amazing new channel for political activism and free speech.
