Main WaterField bag that I put everything else into

I realized today when I was packing that just about everything I pack is in a little sub-bag. I'm not normally an anal person, but having bags in bags with a proper place for every cable and plug helps me structure my packing and pack without thinking too hard. One of the most important components of this system is my [WaterField bag](http://www.sfbags.com/) gear. I've been using these bags for awhile since Reid turned me on to them, but I keep buying every new specialized pouch they come out with. I'm an addict...

I also LOVE the [Eagle Creek Pack-It Folders](http://www.eaglecreek.com/40154.html) that keep your shirts together and has this cool plastic thing that helps you fold your shirts.
