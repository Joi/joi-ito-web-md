Inspired by [Maciej's anti-audioblogging manifesto](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/09/01/audioblogging_manifesto.html), I started working on an audioblogger mashup. I'm not very good at this yet, but here's what I've got so far. (1.8 MB mp3).

I'm going to keep working on this, but if anyone wants to pitch in and give me a hand... hint hint...

UPDATE: I'm taking this down because Maciej says it's freaking him out. ;-)
