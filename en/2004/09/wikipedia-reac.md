[Wikipedia has just announced](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_press_releases/One_million_Wikipedia_articles_%28US%29/Print) that it has reached one million articles. Congratulations Wikipedians! Wikipedia is in more than 100 languages with 14 currently having over 10,000 articles. It is ranked one of the ten most popular reference sites on the Internet according to [Alexa.com](http://www.alexa.com/) (trumping Reuters, the Wall Street Journal and the LA Times). At the current rate of growth, Wikipedia will double in size again by next spring.

Wikipedia is a volunteer effort supported by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation. Please contribute to their [fundraising effort](http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Fundraising).
