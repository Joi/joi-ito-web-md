When Jim gave me my first Moleskine notebook, I didn't realize that I would become part of the Moleskine mania. Since then, I see these notebooks everywhere. I have recently been added to the fan blog, [moleskinerie](http://www.moleskinerie.com/). [Antoin has some interesting thoughts](http://www.eire.com/blogarchives/000164.html) on the narrative and branding by Mondo e Mondo, the Italian firm making these things.
