I'm off to Linz, Austria in a few hours. I'll be attending Ars Electronica. My schedule in Linz is [on my wiki](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?Joi%20Ars%20Electronica%202004). After that, I'm going to Beijing. My travel schedule for the year is also [on my wiki](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?joi_s_travel).

See you all there.
