[Philadelphia is considering investing $10M to blanket 135 square miles with wifi coverage.](http://apnews.myway.com//article/20040902/D84RG1H00.html)

[I agree with David Weinberger](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/003022.html) that the wifi project in Philadelphia is a good thing. Like David, I hear and understand the arguments against government running things that businesses can do, but I think that in the case of some of the low cost basic infrastructure like this, I think municipal governments can often deploy and run it just fine. I think that we need to start thinking of parts of our network as assets like roads, which can and should be run by government.

I will add that in most cases I believe in free markets and competition for this sort of thing.
