[Here's another Iraq war video](http://www.newsgateway.ca/Fallujah_video_massacre.htm). This one appears to be a strike on a group of people walking down a street in Fallujah. Does anyone else have more information on this video? Has it been aired on any TV network?

If they are civilians, it's quite disturbing. The "aw dude" in the audio doesn't seem like a very appropriate reaction.

The embedded Windows Media Player window didn't work for me in Firefox on OS X, but worked fine in Internet Explorer. You can also use [this link](http://www.newsgateway.ca/media/mp_Fallujah_video_massacre_1.asx) to view it directly in Windows Media Player.
