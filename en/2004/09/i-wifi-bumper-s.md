[Christoph Wimmer asks](http://www.engadgeted.net/archives/2004/09/03/apple-prevalence/) where I got my "I )( Wi-Fi" bumpersticker. I got it from [www.bumperactive.com](http://www.bumperactive.com/). It's a very cool site with lots of great bumpersticks. Part of the money is donated to a variety of non-profits. This bumpersticker benefits [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org/).

The "I )( Wi-Fi" bumper sticker can be found on [the Tech Culture page](http://www.bumperactive.com/do/catalog/Search?filterCategory=Tech%20Culture ).
