We (Six Apart) [released Movable Type 3.1](http://www.sixapart.com/log/2004/08/launched_movabl.shtml) today. Some important new features including a dynamic pages and sub-categories. It comes with a plugin pack which includes [MTBlackList 2.0](http://www.movabletype.org/developers_contest_plugin_pack_2004.shtml#MTBlackList). MTBlackList 2.0 is my favorite comment spam zapper.
