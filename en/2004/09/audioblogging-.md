[Maciej](http://www.idlewords.com/) has posted an audioblogging manifesto about why he thinks audioblogging is a stupid idea. Very funny. He makes good points, but I'm not convinced that audioblogging doesn't have a future. Listening to his audioblog makes me want to make a [mashup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastard_Pop) of all of the audiobloggers he mentions. ;-) ([4.1MB mp3](http://www.idlewords.com/audio/manifesto.mp3) / [text version](http://www.idlewords.com/audio-manifesto.txt))
