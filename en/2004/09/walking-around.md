I'm at an airport lounge in Frankfurt Airport and just had a weird experience. There was a huge line and passport control to get into the terminal with my departure gate for my next flight. I decided to go to the lounge. It was sort of a long walk, but when I arrived and asked how to get to my gate, they said it was around the corner - with no security or passport control. Somehow I just "walked around" the passport control.

Now I realize that this is inter-terminal passport control so I have no idea what sort of border it represents, but being able to walk around it seems a bit weird to me...

UDPATE: Although two different people at the lounge assured me it was only minutes away and I didn't have to go through passport control, I somehow got routed back the way I came and though passport control. I asked several times since I was very skeptical. So I either didn't listen to their directions carefully, they were pulling my leg, or they were wrong. Anyway, sorry about the misfire.
