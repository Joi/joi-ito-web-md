It's been nice hanging out in Linz meeting all of the cool people here. I'm off to Beijing today via Frankfurt and Narita. I have a feeling this multi-airport flight is going to suck. Anyway, maybe see you along the way if I can find some wifi.

UPDATE

I said I had a feeling it would suck and it is sucking.

> Gate Agent: Our computer is broken. I can't check you through to your final destination.  
> Me: OK, but please check my bag through to Bejing via Tokyo.  
> Gate Agent: My computer is down. I have to look up the codes by hand. What country is Tokyo in.  
> Me: Japan  
> Gate Agent: Beijing is also in Japan.  
> Me: No, China.  
> Gate Agent: OK. (scribbles down codes and flights on luggage tag.)

> Me: (after running through Frankfurt airport and finding the proper check-in counter after 2 counters forwarding me to another one...) Can you check me through to Beijing. The computer was broken in Linz.  
> Gate Agent: Your reservation has been cancelled.  
> Me: ??!  
> Gate Agent: Let me talk to my colleagues... The computer in Linz was broken.  
> Me: Yes. I know.  
> Gate Agent: I will book you through to Beijing.

> Arrival Gate - Narita, Japan

> Gate Agent: Are you Mr. Ito?  
> Me: Yes.  
> Gate Agent: Can I see your luggage tag?  
> Me: Yes. (hands her luggage tag)  
> Gate Agent: hmmm... (squinting at hand written scribbles) This isn't the code for the Beijing airport. And the flight number is not correct.  
> Gate Agent2: That's the code for the city of Beijing, not the airport. It should probably be OK. And that SORT OF looks like a "9"... Sir, you'll be fine.  
> Me: (doesn't look very fine...)

I'm in Narita now wondering if my bag is really going to show up.

UPDATE 2

My bag and I have arrived safely in Beijing and even gprs seems to work fine!
