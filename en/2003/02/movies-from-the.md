I've posted a two movies clips I took at the anti-war parade in Shibuya. The first one is a [1.7MB QT movie of the Japanese drummers](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/drummers.mov) and the second one is a [780K QT movie of the big black flags](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/blackflag.mov) of the anarchics waving in the air walking down Koendori in front of the Marui department store. I imagined that we were marching for the overthrow of the Japanese government for a moment. ;-)
