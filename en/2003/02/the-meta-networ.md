[The Meta Network](http://www.tmn.com/) and the [Electronic Networking Association](http://dn3.gjhost.com/~cgi/mt/netweaverarchive/cat_electronic_networking_association.html) were just about where it all started for me. My first real company was MDG Japan, a company that distributed Jcaucus (a Japanese version of the Caucus groupware product that MDG was marketing). The ENA was the first computer networking conference where we really started hashing a lot of the issues involving the scaling of online communities. We're still talking about a lot of the same things though... hmm...

> 2003 is our 20th anniversary year for The Meta Network!

We are planning many festivities - including a linked-up set of celebrations the weekend of March 22-23.

We're also looking for artifacts, copies of conversations from the early years, and reminders of some of the highlights and special events we've shared on MetaNet.

If you have something to share or would like to know about special events, join the ANNIVERSARY conference on MetaNet and join the fun!
