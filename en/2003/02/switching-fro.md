[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/12inchswitch-thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/12inchswitch.html)The hinge on my 15 inch TiBook broke. The Powerbook display was hanging on from one hinge. I had to write a paper. My 802.11g base station had just arrived. What to do. I always use the opportunity of [giving forward](http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/02/15#givingForward) as my excuse to buy new stuff. So, I went out and bought a 12 inch PowerBook G4. I copied the system from my 15 inch to my new computer using [Carbon Copy Cloner](http://65.69.94.113/forums/), which is one of my favorite utilities. No go. The new machine didn't recognize the system. I did a fresh re-install and randomly dragged folders to the new machine that looked important. That worked, but took way too much work. Anyway, I'm switched and have set up my 802.11g connection at home and I love it. I just uploaded a [1.7MB QT movie](http://joi.ito.com/images/drummers.mov) to my blog. *zip...* Done. ;-) I'm sitting here gloating instead of writing my paper on emergent democracy which is the excuse I gave myself for making such an impulse buy. Better get back to writing.
