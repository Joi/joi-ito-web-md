As a result of [a short, but useful discussion](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/02/24/long_rss_items.html), I've decided to have have created a new RSS feed. Now I have four feeds for this site: [RSS 1.0 Full Text Feed](http://joi.ito.com/index.rdf), [RSS 1.0 Excerpt Feed](http://joi.ito.com/index.rdf), [RSS 0.91 Full Text Feed](http://joi.ito.com/index.xml), and [RSS 1.0 Comments Feed](http://joi.ito.com/comments.rdf). Now will someone create a way for people to post comments from the RSS clients?
