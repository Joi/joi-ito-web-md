My [moblog](http://joi.ito.com/moblog/) is the first result on [a Google search of "moblog"](http://www.google.com/search?q=moblog) and I am feeling a bit responsible/irresponsible for not improving it much since it started. Hirata did the current template and although it doesn't work well in IE on the Mac, it works well on most browsers. It's light and simple. I don't have any good ideas about how to make it better... hmm...

BTW, we have an [RSS Feed of the moblog](http://joi.ito.com/moblog/index.rdf). I don't know if it is a problem with [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/) but when the name of the entry is the same (in my case "..." when I don't have a title) it doesn't go and retrieve the next picture.
