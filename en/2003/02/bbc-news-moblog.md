Great example of the media harnessing new technology. Now all we need is video. Interesting, this was EXACTLY the example I always used to give when I talked about the future of Internet and IT. This was also the [example I gave to Chairman Shima of NHK](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/02/05/keiji_shima.html) to get him excited about getting online. It's a great feeling to see your "dreams come true." I also remember the news people who laughed at me. I wonder where they are? They're probably still editing tape in expensive studios instead of using a iLife on the Mac. ;-p
