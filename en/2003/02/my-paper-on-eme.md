I've finally started working on my paper on emergent democracy. It basically tracks the "Happening" but it will be for a non-blogging crowd so I will have to describe blogging and a variety of other things we take for granted. I'm going to write it in [OmniOutliner](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/) and will render it with [ActiveRendere](http://radio.weblogs.com/0104487/categories/activeRenderer/) and upstream [it](http://radio.joi.ito.com/outlines/emergentdemocracypaper.html) to [my Radio page](http://radio.joi.ito.com/).
