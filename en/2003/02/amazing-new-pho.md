Dear friends,

recently one of my friends went to Iraq to meet the people and see their lives.  
Soon after he came back he published the book "On a small bridge in Iraq"  
which just came out in Japan.  
Please see the pictures of the Iraqi people and their lives.  
Those are beautiful pictures.  
Can we bomb them, the people just like us?

Please go to <http://www.cafeimpala.com/downloadbookE.html>  
and download the English version of the pdf file.

Peace!!
