![web_sharing_home.gif](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/web_sharing_home.gif)NoteTaker 2003 is a very groovy outliner that does lots of cool things like publish to the web, voice annotation and all kinds of other things that I haven't figured out yet. They [shipped version 1.1](http://www.aquaminds.com/index.jsp) yesterday. Guess what. It does OPML! [I griped about the fact that it didn't do OPML](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/01/04/in_search_of_power_outlining.html), before when I tried the previous release. Maybe this will be the "missing link" in my personal information management struggle. I've just bought it, installed the contextual menu and will try it out. Will report later after I've used it about, but just wanted people to know that it was out.
