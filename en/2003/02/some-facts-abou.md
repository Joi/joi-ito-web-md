(3) From 2024, the actual GDP growth rate might become negative as an on-going trend: by 2025, current account will be in deficits, which, combined with the already aggravated fiscal account deficit, will result in Japan having a twin-deficit problem as a permanent burden.

Entrepreneurship is not socially accepted  
Percentage “yes” on item: People you know respect those starting a new business - 1999  
Japan 10% US almost 100%

Lack of diversity  
4% of the top universities provide 32% of the CEO's for public companies
