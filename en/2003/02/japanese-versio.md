> **"Free use label" for webcontent**
> Last week, Niko pointed me to an interesting article at Asahi.com: ["New rules and copyright labels to let users copy Web content"](http://www.asahi.com/english/national/K2003012500189.html). A quote: "There are three labels. One will say, "This mark indicates material can be copied." The mark lets users copy or print material from Internet Web sites and distribute it without specific permission from the copyright holder, as long as the labeled content is not altered.
> Two other labels will permit unrestricted use of copyrighted material by people with disabilities and for school."

> In Japan, a project called the "[Intellectual Property Outline](http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/policy/titeki/kettei/020703taikou_e.html)" started in July 2002 and includes some provisions that seek to accomplish many of the same goals as the Creative Commons. While it is clear they were not influenced by us directly, it's interesting to watch the convergence of alternate forms of copyright come from governments world-wide.

So I hope we can make sure it "converges" in a world where divergence is quite common.

*Thanks for the pointer Andreas!*
