So, I've been told again that my weblog is really hard to understand. (By a non-blogger). The person said that if I could make it easier to understand, it would have so much more value. On the other hand, my blogging community network seems to be expanding and I generally get positive feedback. So what's one to do?

On the one hand, the blogging community is accelerating and as the tools become second nature, we begin to take many things for granted. The blog is a conversation about many things that only bloggers really understand and with inside jokes and keywords whose explanations span many blogs. On the other hand to most people my blog is a just a web page that is getting more and more strange.

Is there a good solution? Is there a blog that does a good job being just a web page, while at the same time being a great blog? I guess [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net) is great fun for the casual viewer, but is a great blog. On the other hand, it's less of a conversational blog and more of a micro-content/link blog, it seems to me.

Any thoughts?
