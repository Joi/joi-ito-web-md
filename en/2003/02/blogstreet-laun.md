[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/visualneighborhood_large-thumb.gif)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/visualneighborhood_large.html)Blogstreet just launched a new tool that uses Java to let you view your Blogstreet "neighborhood" and click on your neighbors to expand and see their neighborhoods, etc. You get the idea. [The tool is on their site](http://blogstreet.com/visualneighborhood.html) and the developer, [Veer, blogs about it.](http://www.jainnet.com/knowledgeeldorado/archives/2003/02/18/index.html#blogstreet_visual_neighborhood)

I think the tools is fun, but two notes. I don't know my neighbors very well, but maybe that's not the point. Maybe it is about who I SHOULD know... It would be neat to be able to view [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/) data this way. Also, although it is fun, I'm not sure exactly how useful these visualizations are when you're in high-efficiency, I'm-too-busy-to-eat-lunch-because-I'm-blogging mode...

*Although I'm enjoying dragging [Doc](http://doc.weblogs.com/) and [Dave](http://www.scripting.com/) around and watching the other blogs wiggle as they follow Doc and Dave around the screen. It's particularly fun in show "all" mode where there are a lot of blogs following them around... ;-)*
