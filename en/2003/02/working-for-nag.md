[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/naganoyamada-thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/naganoyamada.html)I'm a "Mentor" of the prefecture of "Nagano". I'm not sure exactly what that means, but it does mean that even though today was a national holiday, I spent the afternoon in the Nagano office with the Governor's staff giving advice with the other Mentors on a variety of plans that they had. Actually, it was fun. We are trying to set up a lot of interesting trials involving wireless network webs, community VoIP networks and lots of other rather subversive, but community oriented projects. Nagano is the home of Governor Tanaka, who [I wrote about before.](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/09/02/tanaka_reelected_nagano_gov.html)

After [the trip to Chiba](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/02/08/touring_chiba_with_governor_domoto.html), Mizuka and I are thinking about moving to the countryside and just keeping a small apartment in Tokyo. The Governor's staff in Nagano said that they would help us look for places. I told them we were thinking of moving to either Nagano or Chiba. Nagano is closer, but it's colder. It's a bit classier than Chiba as well... but Chiba has an ocean. hmm...
