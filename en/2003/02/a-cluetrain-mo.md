We recently had a [cluetrain](http://www.cluetrain.com/) moment on my blog. I [wrote an entry](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/01/30/shure_e2c_the_best_headphones_ive_ever_used.html) about the [Shure E2c in-ear headphones](http://www.shure.com/earphones/eseries_accessories.asp). We got a discussion going about great headphones. I don't know if it was because [Google indexed this entry on the first page of search results](http://www.google.com/search?q=Shure+E2c) for "Shure E2c", but Matt, the product specialist for the E2c, dropped in and joined the discussion. He wasn't the marketing or sales guy, but the product specialist. This combination of Google and blogs may create an opinion management and cluetrain manifesto sort of human conversation about products in a much less centralized method than some of the earlier models like [epinions](http://www.epinions.com/).

One more thing that I've been thinking about more and more these days is what Howard's been saying for awhile now. How do we get comments to become a more important part of blogging. [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/) and Slashdot-like sites thrive on comments. Many blogs have very active comment areas. Is there a better way we can structure the indexing so that people have more incentive to comment? I have a feeling that either RSS feeds or how blog entries show up in Google results might be able to highlight comments more.

I sense a fairly active "comment" community developing on my blog. Maybe I should figure out a way to allow active comment contributors to spawn their own blogs on my site...
