[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/tuforest-thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/tuforest.html)I just uploaded some photos that I took in during [my tour of Chiba with Governor Domoto](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/02/08/touring_chiba_with_governor_domoto.html). This moblogging process was a bit more complicated than usual. I took my [Hasselblad 205 FCC and most of my lenses](http://www.photo.net/photodb/user?user_id=576813). I shot both negative and positive film. I then processed them at a lab and had them scanned to PhotoCD format. I imported them into iPhoto, cropped them, enhanced some of them and uploaded them to my iMac web page from IPhoto. The worst part of the process was the PhotoCD part. I had read on the web that PhotoCD works well with negatives, but most of the scans turned out sort of washed out. On top of that, they cost more than $10 per photo to scan. (Still cheaper than professional scanning.) The iPhoto "enhance" feature worked well on the pictures with the busy pictures, but did not work with the pictures with simple objects and few colors. Anyway, if you're interested, the pictures are available as an [.mac album](http://homepage.mac.com/joi_ito/PhotoAlbum5.html).
