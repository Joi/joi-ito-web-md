We just had a "happening" on "emergent democracy". (A conference call about blogs ;-p ) It was great. On the call were Clay Shirky, Ross Mayfield, Pete Kaminski, Gen Kanai, Liz Lawley, and Sébastien Paquet. One of the great things about blogs is that it accelerated the the conversation on the web and increased the bandwith. Phone calls are even faster. We decided that this format was useful. Happenings should happen when some blog meme starts to pick up speed and reaches escape velocity. We are going to try to develop this form of communication as an extention of blogging but use other tools such as Wiki's, chat and IM. We are going to do another 7am Sat Tokyo time. [Click Here](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?year=2003&mon=2&day=21&hour=22&min=0&sec=0) to see what time that is in other time zones. We will be continuing our discussion on emergent democracy, but will be testing this "happening" method of communication.

Send me email with your IM address and blog URL (if you have one) if you want to join the next one.
