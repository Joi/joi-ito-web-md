| The steaming *suppon* pot | The *okoge* |

Today, we had lunch at Daiichi. It is my favorite restaurant. I first went to Daiichi with Shigeaki Saigusa, Ryo Hato and Hiroshi Yanai. Since then, Mizuka and I make it a point to go whenever we are in Kyoto. Daiichi is a *suppon* restaurant. *Suppon* is a kind of soft-shelled snapping turtle. There is no menu. The meal starts out with *suppon* blood (optional), pieces of *suppon* chilled, then the main course. The main course is suppon chopped up and stewed in a very heavy clay pot with sake and soy sauce. The chopped *suppon* is very gelatinous and tastes kind of like a cross between fish and chicken. You add hot sake to the amazing soup and drink it in a cup.

The pot is a special pot that requires extremely high temperatures to heat. These high temperatures can only be achieved using special coal which new restaurants are not approved to use. Once heated, the pot retains the boiling hot temperature for the duration of the course. They use *sake* instead of water and this sake is essential. During the war and in post-war Japan, sake was not available so you had to buy a bottle of *sake* on the black market and bring it with you in order to be served.

After the *suppon* stew comes the *ozoni*. The *ozoni* is prepared by putting rice in the pot with the soup, breaking a few eggs and stirring. After the first servings are removed from the pot, there is a little left on the bottom. This heats and gets crispy and brown. This crispy rice/egg stuff is very good and is called *okoge*. You have to be very careful when scraping the *okoge* from the pot. The pot is fragile and VERY old. If you break a pot they get VERY mad. If you ever break two, you are banned from the restaurant.

I think it must have something to do with the pot, but the *suppon* at Daiichi is superior to any other *suppon* I have ever had and it is consistently great.
