> I plan to attend the anti-war demonstrations on February 15th in [Shibuya,](http://give-peace-a-chance.jp/e215/) Tokyo. This is likely to become the single largest [day of protest](http://www.unitedforpeace.org/article.php?id=725) in world history.

I'm going too. Thanks for the tip Karl-Friedrich. Should we try to organize a blog mob? Who else is going? Is there a poster party before?
