Went to the anti-war parade in Shibuya today. It was the biggest protest of its type that I've been to. (Although I think the [gay and lesbian parade I went to with Kara and Megan](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/09/08/tokyo_lesbian_and_gay_parade_2002.html) was bigger and more fun...) I heard that it was the first protest that circled through the Shibuya route completely before the last team had left, making a full circle.

We were the bloggers against war. We were stuck between the semi-left wing Asian group and a bunch of strange folks with messages on their umbrellas. Later, we ended up next to the Japanese drummers, which was much better. I guess they wanted to do this at the same time all over the world so Japan got stuck after dark. We were a pretty diverse group. I liked the Japanese drummers, the anarchists with the BIG black flags and the "Love not War" folks.

It was pretty interesting and mayb 20% of the people were really having fun. Regardless of the logic, I think it is definitely more fun to be against the war than for it.
