> # Brainwave Building Blog
>
> [Deconism Gallery/Arts Complex](http://eyetap.org/deconism/) was designed as a blog --- something we call "buildinglog" (which, like cyborglog, abbreviates to "glog").
>
> We've all seen smart buildings, smart lightswitches, smart toilets, and intelligent user interfaces, but what happens when you have "smart people"? What happens when you wire up the "intelligence" onto people?
>
> 2003 August 14th and 15th we explore what happens when the intelligent building meets intelligent occupants.
>
> The August 14th event will be an intellectual discussion about the relationship between cyborglogs and buildinglogs. Three panelists (Maurice Benayoun, Pierre Levy, Steve Mann), moderated by the Director of the Marshall McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology, will enter an immersive multimedia space (a brainwave bath) while discussing the implications of the[post-cyborg age](http://www.ctheory.net/text_file.asp?pick=368).
>
> The August 15th event will be an actual collective (de)consciousness where the occupant-cyborgs interact with the building, to create an audiovisual experience from their brainwaves, as part of a brainwave (de)concert performed by jazz musicians Bryden Baird, James Fung, Dave Gouveia, Sandy Mamane, and Corey Manders.
