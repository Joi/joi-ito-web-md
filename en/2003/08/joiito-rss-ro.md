[Brendyn](http://www.thatbigdog.com/soblog/) has created a [page](http://www.thatbigdog.com/rssroll/jiroll/) that lists the online/offline status from [jibot](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/JiBot) as titles and links to all of the recent blog entries of the regulars on [#joiito](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel) from their RSS feeds. Very cool!
