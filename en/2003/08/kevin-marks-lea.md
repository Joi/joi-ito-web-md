Kevin Marks blogs ["How I emailed myself into a job and blogged my way out of it"](http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_08_01_epeus_archive.html#106133327387671172). I was trying to figure out whether I should write something objective and refer to [my strength of weak ties post](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/08/16/jobs_and_the_strength_of_weak_ties.html), but I'm not going to.

Kevin Marks, of [MediAgora](http://www.mediagora.com/) fame and a regular in [#joiito](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel) is one of the most helpful and interesting people I've met recently. A lot of his job involved compiling huge pieces of code on slow machines so he would hang out and help people on #joiito. I feel a bit guilty because I think people on #joiito were a bit demanding of his time, myself included. I remember asking him to take care of my nephew and niece over iChat at 4 am in California while I did some cooking.

Anyway, I think this is a great loss to Apple, but may end up being a good thing for Kevin, MediAgora and the social software space. I am obviously talking to Kevin about "his next thing" but I encourage people who are looking for partners and are interested in someone who understands streaming media, alternative music distribution theories and social software to talk to Kevin. Now is your chance. (And if you come of with something cool to do, talk to me before you talk to any other venture capitalists. ;-) )
