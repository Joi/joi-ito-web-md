I'm off to Beppu for the [HyperNetwork conference](http://www.hyper.or.jp/activity/bbc2003/index.html). Had dinner with [Howard](http://www.smartmobs.com/) who's also going to be speaking. I will be co-moderating a panel on Blogging. I'll try to be on [IRC](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel) during the conference. See you there.
