[![](http://www.loomcom.com/loaf.gif)](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/LOAF) There's a lot of talk about LOAF these days on [#joiito](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel). It's getting pretty hard to keep track of all of these new acronyms. It seems to be an emerging standard, and there isn't much about it on the web yet. jibot on #joiito seems to know the most about it. The only reference I've seen on the web is on [britta's blog](http://jeweledplatypus.org/news/text/internet/loaf.html/).
