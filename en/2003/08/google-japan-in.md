In other "search news"...

Heard a rumor that Google Japan has moved into new digs in the posh Cerulian Tower with a Segway, massage chair, pool table, a lava lamp and everything. Congrats to all of the Infoseek Japan alum working at Google Japan. You've reached, "search nirvana". *I'm a bit envious. ;-)*
