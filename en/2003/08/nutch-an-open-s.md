Mitch Kapor and Tim O'Reilly are among advisory board members of [Nutch](http://www.nutch.org/docs/index.html), a new open source search engine project which will try to:
> - fetch several billion pages per month
> - maintain an index of these pages
> - search that index up to 1000 times per second
> - provide very high quality search results
> - operate at minimal cost

Sounds good to me!
