On [#joiito](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel), JMendelson asked a question and I replied with a URL. Then:
> Brendyn: that's a page slap  
> JMendelson: a what?  
> Brendyn: you were page slapped :)

I wonder if [Brendyn](http://www.rit.edu/~bwa5099/) coined this word. It's a funny word.

Since I blog just about anything important that I ever think of, I end up page slapping people a lot on IRC when they ask questions that I've already answered. I wonder if it's rude? I don't think so.
