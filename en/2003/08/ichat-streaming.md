![](http://joi.ito.com/images/ichatstream.gif)Got iChat Streaming Icon from Kuri yesterday. It is [available on the Apple site.](http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/email_chat/ichatstreamingicon.html) It streams live video of you as your iChat icon. Sooo cool. You can set refresh rates from .5 sec on up. I think it's basically just changing your icon image every frame. It slows the computer down a bit, but is really amazing. All of the images move in every window, even in the buddy list. Once all of your friends get it, you get the Brady Bunch thing happening in the buddy list.

I get to be Alice! ;-p

Seriously though... This suddenly adds a whole new dimensions to the presence discussion.
