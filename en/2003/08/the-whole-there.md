> NOW THAT'S, ER, CHUTZPAH: Christopher Hitchens is [Fisking the Ten Commandments.](http://www.msnbc.com/news/958228.asp?0sl=-12)

Frank Boosman [also comments](http://www.boosman.com/blog/archives/000918.html) on the problem with the "Thou Shalt Have No Other Gods Before Me" commandment.

Like I keep saying, all of you "I only have one God, and my God is the best" people seem to be a bit insecure about your God. As Christopher Hitchens says, "The first four of the commandments have little to do with either law or morality, and the first three suggest a terrific insecurity on the part of the person supposedly issuing them."

As we Shintos like to say, you can put your god over there next to our other gods. While you're at it, why don't you get off your high horse and quit defining Good and Evil as Us and Them. ;-p
