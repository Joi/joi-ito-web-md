![](http://joi.ito.com/images/sm-SW824closeup.jpg)Washlets are the Japanese version of the bidet. They spray a jet of water that can be adjusted in pressure, angle, temperature. The fancy ones have motion sensors to open the seat and flush automatically. Some create a smell curtain with air jets and filters, others have remote controls, seat heaters, etc. They range in price from a few hundred dollars to thousands of dollars. You really have to try one to understand the appeal, but having a focused warm jet of water is much different than a bidet.
During a panel discussion the other day, professor Takeuchi explained that washlets have now reached a 50% market penetration in Japanese households. This is amazing really. So the question was, with all of the talk about culture being Japan's next big export, will washlets be the next big Japanese export?
Toto, the Japanese toilet company has an [English language page](http://www.totousa.com/toto/chloewashlet.asp) for their very simple washlet. Watch the video, it's great. *Thanks for the link [Boris](http://bopuc.levendis.com/RowBoat/)!*
