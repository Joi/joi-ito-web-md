I first heard about the [Shure earphones](http://www.shure.com/earphones/eseries_accessories.asp) from Barak and bought the e2c's. [I blogged about it.](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/01/30/shure_e2c_the_best_headphones_ive_ever_used.html) With the help of Google, people interested in e2c's including Matt, who was the product manager for the e2c's found my blog entry. When the e5c's came out, [I blogged about them too](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/01/shure_e5c_im_in_sound_heaven.html). Hundreds of comments later, both of these entries have become discussions including testimonials and lots and lots of answers from Matt replying to questions about the products and distribution. This human voice dialog is why I think blogging is so great for companies with great products.

Last week, I talked to Matt and Susan from Shure on the phone about experimenting with blogs. Matt's started [a blog](http://blog.neoteny.com/matt/). Hopefully we can set up some combination of a wiki and a blog to help Shure reach out to us and for us to give them feedback.
