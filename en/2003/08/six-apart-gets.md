Glad to see Six Apart finally [moved into an office](http://mena.typepad.com/photos/office/) and moved out of their apartment. In Japan, they call apartments *apart*. When we announced our investment in Six Apart to our investors, two of them asked if we were getting into real estate investments.

Also, Anil says I'm "[consorting with the enemy](http://joi.typepad.com/photos/brainstorm2003/cimg0021.html)"... Well, [Anil](http://www.dashes.com/anil/), what's up with [that T-Shirt](http://mena.typepad.com/photos/office/dscn2976.html)?
