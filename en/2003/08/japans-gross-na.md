I was talking to [Halley](http://halleyscomment.blogspot.com/) today about being cool. American's think they're pretty cool, but the Japanese are getting pretty cool these days too.

At the [Japan dinner that I MC'ed this year](http://slate.msn.com/id/2077083/entry/2077727/), [Tony Kobayashi](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/11/01/talk_at_doyukai.html), the former head of the Association of Corporate Executives talked about the Foreign Affairs article on Japan's Gross National Cool. Maybe Japan's coolness can save it. This was also the topic of the [CNN interview that I did](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/07/25/interview_at_cnn_today.html) which should air any day now on CNN International when they find a boring day to fill. ;-p

Japan is reinventing superpower—again. Instead of collapsing beneath its widely reported political and economic misfortunes, Japan’s global cultural influence has quietly grown. From pop music to consumer electronics, architecture to fashion, and animation to cuisine, Japan looks more like a cultural superpower today than it did in the 1980s, when it was an economic one. But can Japan build on its mastery of medium to project an equally powerful national message?
