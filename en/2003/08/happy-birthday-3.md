I love my [birthday roll](http://joi.ito.com/bday.html). Because of my birthday bot, I know that today is [Xeni](http://www.xeni.net/), [Jason](http://www.blogrolling.com) and [Reid's](http://www.linkedin.com) birthday. Imagine that. Three of my favorite people have the same birthday! I also love my birthday roll, because I can send personal email to people on their birthdays and spread my "pings" over the year instead of writing hundreds of Christmas cards. I should dump holiday gifts and cards all together and switch to birthdays.
