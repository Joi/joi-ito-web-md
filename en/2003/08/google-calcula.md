> Google now has [a built in calculator](http://www.google.com/help/features.html#calculator) that can tell you everything from [2+2](http://www.google.com/search?q=2%2B2) to [speed of light in furlongs per fortnight](http://www.google.com/search?q=speed+of+light+in+furlongs+per+fortnight) to [2048 in binary](http://www.google.com/search?q=2048+in+binary).

Very cool!
