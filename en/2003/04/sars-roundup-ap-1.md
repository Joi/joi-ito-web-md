I just had lunch with a friend from Hong Kong. He said people are
pretty freaked out. All of the schools are closed and hotels are at 10%
capacity. He says that you can actually trace the infections back to a
doctor from China who visited Hong Kong for a wedding. He sneezed in an
elevator and all of the people who were in the elevator are now dead.
There was a rumor that the people who got the disease from him all died,
but the people who got the disease from those people haven't all died
and that the virus diminishes in deadliness as it is transmitted, but it
appears to be a rumor. People in HK are stocking up, partially because
of the teenager hoax which involved a forgery of a newspaper site
blowing the problem out of proportion and sending everyone into a panic.
Seven people are reported to have symptoms in Japan and are being
tested, but they they have not been confirmed to have SARS.

Everyone in HK is wearing masks, although it probably doesn't help.
Immigration officers in Tokyo are wearing masks, but only telling people
who have fevers, have visited risk countries and are coughing to go to
the quarantine office. People in China still seem to be under-informed
and are not wearing masks.
