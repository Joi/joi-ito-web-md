Great [paper](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/jmoore/secondsuperpower.html) by James Moore at the [Berkman Center for Internet & Society](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/) about how the "will of the people" is the emerging second superpower. He talks about emergent democracy, the Internet and gives a bunch of great examples.

> In any case, what I most want to share with you is my paper “The Second Superpower Rears its Beautiful Head” (the title was suggested by Esme Bashwiner).  The point of the paper is that “the movement” is now approaching the status of “the second superpower,” after the United States.  This is due to (1) critical mass of people who identify with the world rather than the nation, with each other rather than just themselves, (2) the web and interactive media “neurology” of the movement—including texting, email lists, and blogging—which is giving it a kind of collective mind and ability to act, and (3) the advance of international institutions and international law, which provides a venue or a forum in which the second superpower can work with sympathetic nations to press its cause.  The Bush administration is attacking the fabric of the international system, but it is unlikely to prevail.

Jim is one guy who I was HOPING would start a blog. Thanks to [Dave](http://www.scripting.com/) and [Doc](http://doc.weblogs.com/), he's [got one](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/jim/) now.
