I've used a cool Flash tool called [Indy Junior](http://www.bryanboyer.com/indyjunior/) to render [a clickable map of my travels this year](http://joi.ito.com/archives/static/joimap.html). Indy Junior was developed by Bryan Boyer based on similar map done by my friend [Joshua Davis](http://www.joshuadavis.com/). Requires Flash.
