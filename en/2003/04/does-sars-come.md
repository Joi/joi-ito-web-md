A few quotes from the [proMED-mail](http://www.promedmail.org/pls/askus/f?p=2400:1000:5376218400840476), which is a good list to follow for on-the-ground updates from the global medical community.

> claimed 79 lives, and the etiological agent appears to be far less
> contagious than Influenza A virus.
