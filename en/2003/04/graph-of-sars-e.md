Here is [a site](http://squeak.org/us/ted/sars-graph.html) with a graph of the SARS epidemic. Incidentally, it is powered by [Squeak](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/02/04/croquet_the_os_of_the_future.html).
> Epidemics usually follow S-shaped curves. The predictions here are based on pure exponential growth. When the middle of the S-shaped curve is reached, the rate of infection will slow, and exponential growth predictions will no longer be useful. The reported data shows that the epidemic is still in an exponential growth phase.
