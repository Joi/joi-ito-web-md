As a Quaker, I wonder if you're allowed to think about [hard-on's in church](http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/03/17#caughtBetweenIraqAndAHardon) and [joke about people's deaths on your blog.](http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/04/18#otherDeadAtkinsHeadlines) Or maybe being an A-List blogger forces you to resort to [deadpan humor](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/18/have_a_day_anil.html) to tighten up your style. ;-|

> I'm still on the Atkins diet. [Dr. Atkins](http://www.mercola.com/2003/apr/19/robert_atkins.htm) isn't , of course. I mentioned that a couple days ago under the headline Ultimate Diet . Since then I've regretted not using either of two other headlines that came to mind at the time:

100% weight loss   
   
Dead weight Anyway, both Doc and I are on the Atkins Diet which is basically a low-carb diet. Many people swear by it, but many people continue to [warn me against it](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/04/04/fat_club_update.html#n006002). It's too bad that [Dr. Atkins died](http://www.mercola.com/2003/apr/19/robert_atkins.htm), but at least he died of an injury and not of something that could be tied to the Atkins diet.
