[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/robertsakura-thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/robertsakura.html)Robert Kaye of Musicbrainz arrived in Tokyo yesterday. The cherry blossom season is about to end, but Robert had cherry blossoms in his hair so the season will be a little longer this year. We had dinner and talked about RDF.

I met him when I was in SF last time and I wrote about it [here.](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/07/robert_kaye_from_musicbrainz.html) Thanks for introducing us [Lisa!](http://www.onlisareinsradar.com/)
