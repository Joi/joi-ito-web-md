Bill Emmott, the editor of *The Economist* visited Japan on his tour through Asia. Ever since I met Bill, I've become subscriber of the paper version of and an avid reader of The Economist. Bill is a Japan expert and has written numerous books about Japan. It's great having someone who knows as much as Bill as the editor *The Economist* since Japan is not getting much coverage these days. We talked about the feedback Bill has been getting on the strong stance *The Economist* took on the war and how interesting and useful the feedback was. Brian noted that Bill got more feedback because his articles had his name on them. I explained that a lot of bloggers link to articles in *The Economist* and that if they used Technorati, they could track bloggers writing about the articles and get feedback more quickly and in more detail.

We also talked a lot about Japan and many of the problems Japan faces. Bill is very supportive of our efforts and I hope that with Brian's help, we can get *The Economist* to cover Japan in an objective way. Media coverage will be essential in our efforts to push for more transparency.
