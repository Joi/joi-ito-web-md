[![](http://joi.ito.com/images/chandler01-tm.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/images/chandler01.jpg)You have all probably heard about the [Open Source Applications Foundation](http://www.osafoundation.org/) [release of Chandler 0.1](http://downloads.osafoundation.org/chandler/releases/0.1/). I just downloaded it. I saw it on [Mitch's blog](http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000166.html) a few days ago, but I was SOO immersed in writing a birthday database in [Python](http://www.python.org/) that I didn't take a close look at Chandler until this morning. To my pleasant surprise, Chandler is written in python for the Mac and even handles birthdays. ;-) It doesn't run without spitting out lots of Python errors along the way, but I can actually understand them now! Hoho. Haha. Python is VERY cool and I'm glad OSAF is using Python. We used it a lot at Infoseek and our team at Infoseek/Digital Garage actually wrote some of the first Japanese language handling for Python.

I'm currently using [Mark Pilgrim](http://diveintomark.org/)'s [Dive Into Python](http://diveintopython.org/) to learn Python. It's a great tutorial. *Thanks for recommending it Sen.*. Of course I've bought the numerous O'Reilly books as well.
