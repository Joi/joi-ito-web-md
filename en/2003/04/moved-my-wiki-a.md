I've moved my Wiki to a semi-permanent server and started adding content. The URL is: <http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/> One page, I thought might be interesting was a [public To Do List](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/JoiToDo?action=show). Anyone who wants me to do something or who wants to reach me should feel free to add to my public To Do List. I promise to check it every day. Please make sure you sign the To Do entry and also create a homepage on my Wiki with your contact info so I can track you more easily. This is an experiment so any constructive thoughts would be greatly appreciated.
