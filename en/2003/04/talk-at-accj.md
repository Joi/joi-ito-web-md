[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/DSC00253-thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/DSC002531.html)Gave a talk at the American Chamber of Commerce of Japan yesterday. Americans living in Japan are the most fun to speak to because they generally agree with what I say. ;-) It's a bit like preaching to the choir and obviously, I'm not adding as much value as when I'm debating with my opponents, but the Q&A session after my talk was good and there were a lot of good comments and thoughts. In addition to my "ad hoc society of Japanese revolutionary wannabes" maybe I should try to participate in more meetings about democracy with foreigners living in Japan...

I was at the lunch table with Thierry Porte and Kumi Sato, both vice presidents of ACCJ who told me that I have to become a member of the ACCJ. ;-)

Anyway, I talked about Democracy, Weblogs, Risks and Japan. It was a slightly modified and improved version of the talk I gave at the MIT Forum. Here is the [32MB PDF file](http://joi.ito.com/archives/static/joiaccj.pdf) of my Keynote presentation.

Update: Here's the [12MB Keynote file](http://joi.ito.com/archives/static/joiaccj.key.zip).
