[Adriaan](http://www.kung-foo.tv/blog/index.php) just finished the new release of [Kung-Log](http://www.kung-foo.tv/kunglog.php), the MT client for OS X. He's implemented the thumbnailing feature I asked for and it is now perfect. I can do ALL of my primary blogging from Kung-Log. One thing that is not documented but very useful is the proportionalization of the thumbnail. Enter either the width or the height and tab or click the other box to have it calculate the proportional size for the other field.
*It's talking the MetaWeblog API so it works for other CMS/blog systems as well, but well tuned for MT*
