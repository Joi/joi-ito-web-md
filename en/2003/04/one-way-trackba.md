Very interesting thing just happened. (Once again, standard disclaimer... I'm obviously not the first person to have this experience, but it's new to me...)

I got [a trackback](http://joi.ito.com/cgi-bin/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&entry_id=5098) on my [iTunes entry](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/04/29/the_sucking_sound_of_drm_itunes_4.html) (the first trackback there...) from a Japanese MT blog. Anyway, I went over to the site and it was indeed an entry about iTunes, but no mention of me or my blog. Also, no link back.

So, maybe I feel a bit hurt, but nothing illegal going on here. Obviously it makes sense to try to direct people to more information about a topic and sending a trackback to an entry about the same topic makes sense. It just felt weird. I had been looking at trackback more as a two-way thing, but I guess they are technically one way.

Anyone have any thoughts on this? Obviously, if it were spam or a link to a unrelated topic, I would erase the trackback, but it is a link to a legitimate entry about the same topic and I wouldn't think about erasing it. I guess it's just that I've never trackbacked to anyone that I didn't link to except in the case of a topic exchange thread...
