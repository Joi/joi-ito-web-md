[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/sakurablue-thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/sakurablue.html)Mizuka and I went to see the last cherry blossoms last week and I shot some Provia 100 with my Hasselblad. I got sick of the poor quality of the Photo CD's considering the cost and bought a [Nikon 8000ED](http://www.nikonusa.com/usa_product/product.jsp?cat=7&grp=703&productNr=9246) film scanner so I could do my own scans instead. Here's my first attempt. I'm still trying to figure out how to get it right and it does take a lot of time, but you have control and obviously much more tender loving care than the people scanning for you onto Photo CD's. I've posted a few pictures [on my .mac site](http://homepage.mac.com/joi_ito/PhotoAlbum7.html). I can't figure out what the white space is that gets inserted when I publish from iPhoto.

Anyway, my iLife just got better thanks to Nikon.
