Pierre Omidyar, my classmate from Tufts, founder of [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/), an advisor to and investor in [Neoteny](http://www.neoteny.com/) and a good friend, recently started [a blog](http://www.ginx.com/~pierre/). (A [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) blog. I think he started his blog before he knew we were investing... ;-) )

He [responds](http://www.ginx.com/~pierre/archives/000022.html) to [my entry about blogshares](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/04/25/chat_with_seyed_creator_of_blogshares.html). He seems to be thinking about the money vs. influence / markets vs. democracy issues as well. Being a billionaire philanthropist geek is an interesting position to be in when thinking about whether having more money should mean you have more influence and he's clearly been thinking about this a lot.

Welcome to the blogging community Pierre.

*I'm going to comment on his comments when I have more time. I'm eating turtle stew right now...*
