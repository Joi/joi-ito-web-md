Happy Birthday [Liz](http://www.it.rit.edu/~ell/mamamusings/)! Thank you for showing people how t use my new [public To Do List](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/JoiToDo).

BTW, She's a [tuppeware lady](http://www.it.rit.edu/~ell/mamamusings/archives/000420.html). Funny because I call the "you have to try it to understand why it is useful" aspect of Internet and blogs the "tupperware syndrome".
