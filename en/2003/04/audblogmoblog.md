I've decided to put my English language audblog posts in my [moblog](http://joi.ito.com/moblog/). You will see audio interspersed between the photos from my camera. I will try to put some audio about the photos that I post. It would be cool if I could have the audio attached to the photos themselves, but that's a pain to figure out right now. Also, since I usually shoot photos in clusters around events, I think maybe a series of photos followed by some audio might be the right format for this.

I'm going to start audblogging on my main Japanese blog since my written Japan sucks and maybe I can be a bit more interesting via audblog.
