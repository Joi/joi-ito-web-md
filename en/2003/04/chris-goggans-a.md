| Chris giving me his new Tokyo University name card with Professor Yasuda looking on |

Professor Yasuda and "Visiting Associate Professor" Chris Goggans visited our office today. Professor Yasuda has invited Chris to Tokyo University as a Visiting Associate Professor to help educate Japan about security and to break into a few computers. ;-) Chris is now officially faculty at the most prestigious university in Japan. Amazing. I played my own little role by writing a recommendation for him, but hats-off to Professor Yasuda for pulling this off. I think this is GREAT. Chris has the hands-on experience that many of the so-called security experts in Japan lack and having him firmly embedded in the establishment, even for a short period, should have an enormous positive impact on the understanding.

It will also be fun to have Chris around Tokyo for awhile.
