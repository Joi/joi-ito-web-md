| Hasegawa-san, the CEO of Global Dining, at the La Boheme bar |

Had dinner last night at [G-Zone Ginza](http://216.119.105.170/site/restaurants/index.cfm?resID=139&page=detail&lang=EN&chainId=2) Global Dining's new restaurant complex in Ginza. Yesterday was the first day in business. It's a HUGE space with a Gonpachi, a Zest, a Monsoon, and a La Boheme, all Global Dining restaurants. It feels almost like Disneyland, tunnels connecting the restaurants and lots and lots of theme stuff like a fake entrance to a Western Inn, etc. The opening party the day before attracted about 4000 people. Hasegawa-san, the CEO of Global Dining, Jun (my partner who is on Global Dining's board), Oki Matsumoto the CEO of Monex and I ate at Gonpachi. The sushi looked REALLY good, but I kept away from the carbs...

On the synchronicity side, the twin brother of a guy who has worked for me at Infoseek forever, Hamano, is in charge of facilities and suprised me. Also, the former manager of Tableaux Lounge in Daikanyama where I used to hang out A LOT is now the manager of La Boheme in Ginza G-Zone. Anyway, you can reserve rooms, they're open late. I think G-Zone will be my Ginza hangout, although I rarely have any reason to go to Ginza these days.
