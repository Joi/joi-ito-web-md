The last time I saw [Ben](http://www.stupidfool.org/) and [Mena](http://www.dollarshort.org/), I showed them the "the cork trick". It's a trick I learned from a teenager in Belgium. Basically, you take two corks, hold them vertically with your thumbs, grab the ends of the cork in the other hand with your forefinger and thumb with both hands and remove the corks. (impossible to explain without a demo or photos.) It's much hard than it looks and also very difficult by the time you have two corks. It's a great way to impress people.

It took me quite a while to be able to repeat it consistently, but apparently Mena, my cork prodigy, is much more talented than me. [Anil](http://anildash.com/) sent me a link to [Mena doing the cork trick at SXSW on Jason Levine's site](http://q.queso.com/slideShow.php?pic=307).
