[Scoble](http://scoble.weblogs.com/), who was doing TabletPC's at NEC has left and joined Microsoft. He's an important part of the blogging community and I hope this ends up changing Microsoft in a good way. Good luck Scoble. I have mixed feelings, but I've shared them with him. I think it's the right think for him though.

It reminds me the [quote from David Smith on Frank Boosman's blog](http://www.boosman.com/blog/archives/000358.html) about the similarity between people's view of MS and the US.

Since Dave Winer [blogged this news already](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/04/15#When:12:36:29PM), I assume I can too. ;-)
