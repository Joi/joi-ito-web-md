[![Powered by audblog](http://www.audblog.com/media/images/audblog_post.gif)](http://www.audblog.com/media/4222/14621.mp3)[audblog audio post](http://www.audblog.com/media/4222/14621.mp3)  
My first [Audblog](http://www.audblog.com) post. It finally works with MT! So now I have to figure out the style. Do I post in my main blog? I can't set the categories, add titles or text from the phone so it initially appears in my blog as just an clickable audblog logo with no text, title or category. Hmmm...

You know what would be neat? If I could voice annotate the photos in my moblog. So... How to link the photos with the audblog entries... I guess I could write a **Python** script to search for moblog entries and audblog entries within 10 minutes of each other and cross-link them. ;-)
