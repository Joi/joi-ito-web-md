Mizuka and I attended the 131rd Annual Miyako Odoro. We have attended every year since we met. It is the annual event where the *geisha* of the Gion district perform their traditional dance. The event is open to the public, but is a lot about the patrons of the tea houses getting a chance to see the *geisha* and *maiko* perform their art that they practice so hard to perfect through the year.

| The *geisha*, and *maiko* are given tickets that they must sell to their patrons. The tea houses pick up many of these tickets and distribute them to their clients. Mizuka and I always buy a pair from Kaoru.    The show consists of a plot that changes every year, but it all is framed in four sections and there is a scene for each season where all of the *maiko* come out in a line.    On the left hand side of the theater, the Japanese drums and the Japanese flutes play. The *geisha* playing the flute in this picture is our good friend Fukunami.    On the right side of the theater are the *geisha* who play the *shamisen* and sing. The *geisha* third from the left is Kimiya-san and the *geisha* second from the left is Komomo-san. Both good friends.    And everyone shows up for the grand finale!    The *geisha* also do a tea ceremony for the guests.    The Japanese green tea made and served by the *geisha* is nice and you get to keep the plate that the snack comes on. (Sorry again Dr. Atkins!) |
