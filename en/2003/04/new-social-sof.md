A [new group weblog](http://www.corante.com/many/) authored by [Elizabeth Lane Lawley](http://www.it.rit.edu/~ell/mamamusings/), [Ross Mayfield](http://radio.weblogs.com/0114726/), [Sébastien Paquet](http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/), Jessica Hammer and [Clay Shirky](http://www.shirky.com/) to focus on social software was announced at ETCon I hear. Great team and looks interesting. It's also great that Clay is finally blogging after all of that "it's not for me" business. ;-)
