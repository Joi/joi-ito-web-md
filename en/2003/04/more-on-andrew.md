Kevin Marks has written [a nice rebuttal](http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_04_01_epeus_archive.html#200094183) to [Andrew Orlowski's article about googlewashing](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/30087.html).

Also, FYI it wasn't because I am a "a colossus of authority" that Jim Moore's article took off on Google, but probably because the true colossus, [Dave Winer](http://www.scripting.com/) wrote about it. Actually, I first heard about Jim's blog because Dave met Jim and emailed [Doc](http://doc.weblogs.com/) and me about [Jim's new blog](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/jim/). (In any event, collosal is a collosal word. I think Andrew had probably just finished reading the article about the [colossal squid](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2910849.stm).)
