Andrew Orlowski has an [article in The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/30087.html) about how Jim Moore's [paper about the Second Superpower](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/jmoore/secondsuperpower.html) spread so quickly it now ranks #1 on Google. Talks about how A-List blogs contribute to the ability for a single entry to quickly outrank versions of the word. (Cory talks about this phenomenon a lot.) Flattering mention of my blog... ;-p

> Moore's subversion of the meaning of "Secondary Superpower" - his high PageRank™ from derives from followers of 'A-list' tech bloggers linking from an eerily similar "Emergent Democracy" discussion list, which in turn takes its name from a similarly essay posted by Joi Ito [[Lunch](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/08/chillin_with_larry_page.html) - [Lunch](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/08/shooting_the_breeze_with_stewart_alsop.html) - [Lunch](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/10/kim_says_the_buzz_is_back.html) - [Segway](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/25/my_first_segway_ride.html) - [Lunch](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/31/chatting_about_open_standards_with_president_ando_of_sony.html) - [Lunch](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/04/01/lunch_with_aaron_.html) - [Fawning Parody](http://joi.mmdc.net/)] who is a colossus of authority in these circles, hence lots of PageRank™-boosting hyperlinks, and who like Moore, appeared from nowhere as a figure of authority.

Lunchin' Ito's essay is uncannily similar to Moore's - both are vague and elusive and fail to describe how the "emergent" democracy might form a legal framework, a currency, a definition of property or - most important this, when you're being hit with a stick by a bastard - an armed resistance (which in polite circles today, we call a "military").The phenomenon Andrew writes about is quite interesting although the article is a bit nasty. Obviously Andrew doesn't think much about blogging.

> Here's a mechanism which allows a billion people who can't sing, can't write a song or make an original beep, and have nothing to express, the means to deafen me with their tuneless, boring cacophony.

IMHO, I think Andrew should join the conversation instead of griping and acting like a magazine on the coffee table at a cocktail party...
