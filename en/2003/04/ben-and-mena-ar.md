[Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/about/ ) (Ben and Mena's company, the creator of Movable Type) just [announced](http://www.sixapart.com/press/six_apart_ltd_announces_new_weblogg.shtml) their [hosted service](http://www.sixapart.com/press/six_apart_ltd_announces_the_typepad.shtml), [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com/). They also announced that [Anil has joined the team](http://www.sixapart.com/press/six_apart_ltd_names_anil_dash_as_vi.shtml). Also somewhere in the announcement is a bit about my company, [Neoteny](http://www.neoteny.com/) [investing in Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/press/six_apart_ltd_announces_close_of_se.shtml). I'm very excited both as a Movable Type user/fan and as an investor.

This is probably one of the most exciting investments we've made and I particularly like the fact that I started as a user, sponsor, friend and finally an investor. I really like Ben and Mena and wish we could find more deals that were as cool as this.

Congratulations and lots of thanks to the whole team who worked to make this deal happen!

Cheers!
