I first started using a Wiki in the [Emergent Democracy](http://www.socialtext.com/workspace/index.cgi?Emergent%20Democracy%20index) [Happening](http://www.socialtext.com/workspace/index.cgi?Happening) because the [SocialText](http://www.socialtext.com/) folks [used a Wiki](http://www.socialtext.com/workspace/index.cgi) to organize the information. I had visited Wiki's before and knew about them, but the ED Happening was the first time I had really used one. Then I saw [Robert Kaye](http://www.musicbrainz.org/) using a Wiki to take notes and he said he was addicted. Robert runs [MoinMoin Wiki](http://moin.sourceforge.net/) on his PowerBook. I figured that running the same Wiki software as Robert would be a good place to start. I got it running on my PowerBook, decided that I wanted one in a public place too, so I put one on my XServe box. I've been surfing around WikiSpace today trying to understand all of the interesting things like [InterWiki](http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?InterWiki) links and stuff.

So, my plan is to take notes locally on my PowerBook and paste publishable stuff onto [my public Wiki](http://stream.joi.ito.com:8080/joiwiki). Using the same software lets me keep the punctuation which seems to be different between Wiki's.

So my question to all of you Wiki gurus is this. Is there any way to get OPML into a Wiki easily? I've been taking notes in [NoteTaker](http://www.aquaminds.com/index.jsp) which exports to OPML. My blogroll and just about every outline I have is in OPML. I would LOVE to be able to import this into my Wiki...
