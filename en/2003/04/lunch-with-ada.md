[![](http://joi.ito.com/images/adamgreenfield-tm.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/images/adamgreenfield.jpg)Had lunch with Adam Greenfield. I met Adam online and recently have developed a relationship with him. This was the first time we shared a meal together. Recently he protected me against Richard B., coined the term [moblog](http://joi.ito.com/), launched a new site called [Margin Walker](http://www.marginwalker.org) and has a cool [site called v-2](http://http://www.v-2.org/) where he blogs. He wrote a paper called [a minimal compact](http://www.v-2.org/displayArticle.php?article_num=339) about open source constitutions for nation-state sized governance. He's currently organizing a moblog conference in Tokyo in July which I plan to attend.

We talked about a lot of things, but we agreed on two things. He is yet another person who thinks wikis are [butt ugly](http://jason.defillippo.com/blog/archives/000518.phtml) (YAPWTWABU) but I said he should try Wiki's. So I agreed to try to read everything in Margin Walker and contribute and he agreed to post on a [Minimal Compact Wiki Page](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/MinimalCompact) on my Wiki and we'd both try each other's new sites out. Anyway, enjoyed the conversation, but you will hear more about it on Margin Walker and my Wiki. ;-)
