On July 4, [I mentioned here](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/07/04/hecklebot_a_project_to_support_heckling_at_conferences.html) that I thought it would be cool if we made a hecklebot and I started [a wiki page](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/HeckleBot) about it. Many people from [#joiito](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel) contributed. Then on July 12, [David Beckemeyer](http://mrblog.org/) aka twostop [actually built one](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/UcHeckle). I received it yesterday and got it running. The same day, the hecklebot project was mentioned in the New York Times.

> Meanwhile, Mr. Ito is already creating a new riff on the concept. He said he was working with a group on designing a "hecklebot," a light-emitting diode screen that displays heckling messages that are typed during online chats at conferences. "I want to make something that I can put in a suitcase and take to conferences," he said. He describes it as a subversive device that will get people thinking about the significance of the back channel. From the chat room, he said, "you could send something like, 'Stop pontificating.'

What's so great about all this is that it's like the good old days of TCP/IP and HTML when most projects are small enough that one person can hack together really useful tools and everything moves quickly without proposals, flowcharts and approvals. The idea to working demo time cycle is SO short right now. With weblogs, wikis and IRC, feedback, support and testing is extremely efficient.
