| Rebecca MacKinnon, CNN Tokyo Bureau Chief |

I was interviewed at CNN today by CNN in Atlanta in a "live to tape" format. The segment is about generational changes in Japan and the youth culture. I was part of the "studio discussion" after they watch the video. I think I'll be on for about 10 minutes. We talked about a variety of things including the export of Japanese culture to the rest of the world. The interviewer asked whether I thought Japanese music would be the next big thing after *anime*. I said that I thought Japanese music is a good export. I said I thought mobile device culture where the producers are the consumers was more interesting and that this culture would be the bigger export. It was "live" so the question caught me off guard and I didn't express myself well. I didn't get a chance to say "mobblog" on CNN. ;-p

The show should be aired on CNN International next week or so depending on whether there is other "breaking news". I will be a talking head in my own little box. I've been on CNN before, but this is my first "Max Headroom" appearance.

Rebecca, the Tokyo Bureau Chief is a [fellow GLT](http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/Forum+Announces+its+One+Hundred+New+Global+Leaders+for+Tomorrow+2003) and a friend. I set her up with an IRC client and got her logged into [#joiito](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel). She has an exciting and sometimes dangerous job. It definitely looks like a lot of fun. She had a gas mask and a helmut in her office...
