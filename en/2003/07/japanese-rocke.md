According to the Swedes on #joiito, a Japanese space probe just crashed in Sweden. I can't find anything about on English or Japanese language sites. Anyone know anything about this?

Erista [has blogged](http://mymarkup.net/blog/archives/001955.html#001955) about it in Swedish with a link to the to the original article. Manne first discovered the link.
