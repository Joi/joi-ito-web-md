My plane took off, flew for an hour and did a U-turn. Electrical problems. We're switching planes now, but I'm stuck in Japan again. Anyway, I've created a tentive outline of stuff I want to talk about on the panel. Please take a look and feel free to comment. It's [here](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/SuperNovaOutline).

*I got this idea of using a wiki from [Cory](http://www.boingboing.net)*
