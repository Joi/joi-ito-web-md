Howard Dean is [going to guest blog for Lawrence Lessig](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/archives/2003_07.shtml#001348) while he is away on vacation. It is VERY cool that a presidential candidate is blogging. It's also cool that [Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/) can now say that a presidential candidate uses [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/). And how cool is it to be able to say, "Howard Dean's taking care of my blog while I'm away." Nice one Larry!

Let's all welcome Howard Dean to the blog world!
