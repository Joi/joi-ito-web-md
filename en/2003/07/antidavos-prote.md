All dressed up an nowhere to go

When I was in Switzerland, I met someone who was protesting the [Davos meeting](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/01/29/japans_bad_boy_does_davos_slate.html) I attended in January. He gave me one of the hooded sweatshirts that they wore. At first glance, it looked like a normal hooded sweatshirt, but when you zip it up, it quite conveniently covers most of your face. Best looking "protest wear" I've seen. My theory is that most protesters protest to get stuff like this and because it's fun.

*Update: [etoy.ROCK gave me the sweatshirt.](http://feed.etoy.com/archives/000038.html) Thanks ROCK!*
