Ever since Reverend A. K. M. Adam aka [AKMA](http://akma.disseminary.org/) started hanging out on IRC, I've started to think that [#joiito](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel) is a lot like [M\*A\*S\*H](http://www.mash4077.co.uk/index.php), the American TV show about the people in a medical camp during the Korean War. As a Japanese who never went to Western churches, my first exposure to a chaplain was on M\*A\*S\*H. AKMA plays a great chaplain on #joiito. ;-) Like the TV show, there is funny chatter like the doctors chatting during surgery. There are visits by guests who pop by to say hi. There are even battles waging on blogs and the wounded show up at #joiito to hang out and recharge.

Anyway, I'll stop pushing the metaphor now.
