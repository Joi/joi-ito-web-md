Today they were webcasting the [AO2003](http://www.ao2003.com/) conference. They had a chat that they put on the screen every once and awhile. Many of the regulars from the [#joiito IRC channel](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel) dropped in to the chat to do our usual heckling. During the journalists panel that Tony was moderating, the hecklers got quite active. It was "the usual". Some people were a bit rough on Tony, but he was a good sport about it. He did say, "we should charge you guys" to the hecklers, but I was thinking that they should pay US. During a discussion about telecommuniting and the Internet enabling distributed workflow, I mentioned on the chat that I was in my underwear in Tokyo. Then someone, I think [Ross](http://radio.weblogs.com/0114726/), put [JoiTV](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/07/15/ijoitv.html) on the big screen. Then Tony started teasing me. Heckleback! So I thought I was hecklejacking the conferencing and then I got hecklebacked. We need start a lobby for hecklers rights. ;-P

Anyway, it was good fun. Thanks Tony.
