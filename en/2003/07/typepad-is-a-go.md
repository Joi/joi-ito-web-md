My [TypePad weblog](http://joi.typepad.com/weblog/) is live and thanks to design help from [Mena](http://www.dollarshort.org/), it "feels" like this blog, but is light and clean. Let me know what you think. I'm considering making TypePad my main blog.

I'll cross post for awhile, but lets keep the comments on this blog so I can keep them in one place until I do the final export.
