[JesseE](http://www.rystic.com/) suggested that we should have rules on #joiito. He's started [a list of ideas on the wiki](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel#head-87fca054ccbed9f59b77916c5886d1407247aa7c). I'll give everyone a day or so to add to the list and call a real-time summit on the channel to discuss the rules.
