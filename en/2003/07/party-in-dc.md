We had a party in DC the other day. It was great seeing everyone. Thanks for coming. Special thanks to people who contributed on [the wiki page](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/PartyInDC030707) and especially to [rojisan](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/RogerWood) who coordinated the venue.

There are [some great photos](http://jason.defillippo.com/blog/archives/000259.phtml) on [Jason DeFillippo's blog](http://jason.defillippo.com/blog/).
