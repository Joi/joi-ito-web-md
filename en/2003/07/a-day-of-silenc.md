Halley suggested that we all need a day of silence to hear our own voice. I'm going to be on a plane for most of it, but I'm going silent in a few hours for 24 hours. No email, no blogging, nothing. Just a gray marble stone to keep me company. [Halley has begun her silence](http://halleyscomment.blogspot.com/2003_07_20_halleyscomment_archive.html#105927759496782644) already. When I come out silence hopefully I'll have something interesting to share. ;-)
