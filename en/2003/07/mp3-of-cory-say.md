I got Cory to say "[Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net)" into my Olympus voice recorder. Here's the [mp3](http://joi.ito.com/images/boingboing.mp3). Maybe I should start a collection of people saying their blog or product names... Maybe not...

*Also got Cory saying, [venti mocha latte americana frap espresso-chino](http://joi.ito.com/images/corystarbucks.mp3)*
