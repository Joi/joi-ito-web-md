[![](http://joi.ito.com/images/62874-tm.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/images/62874.jpg)I met [Seth](http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/blog/sethgodin.html) in Aspen. He's a "keeper". It turns out that he's a good friend of [Halley's](http://halleyscomment.blogspot.com/). I could have guessed.

During the marketing discussion in Aspen, Seth was one of the few people who I thought really "got it".

He has a thread on his blog about the purple polar bear that ["increased visitor numbers to the zoo by 50%."](http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_801020.html?menu=news.quirkies)

Some people argued that it was a hoax, then Seth dug in and is now convinced that it is true. He says he doesn't want anymore email about it. ;-)

*Where's Halley's blog?!?*
