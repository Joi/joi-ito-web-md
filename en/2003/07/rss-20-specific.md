[Dave Winer moved the RSS 2.0 spec](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/07/18#rss20News) from Userland to the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School. It is now licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share Alike [license](URL). There is now an [advisory board](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/advisoryBoard).
> The initial members of the board are Dave Winer, Berkman fellow and author of the RSS 2.0 spec; Jon Udell, lead analyst for InfoWorld and columnist for the O'Reilly Network; and Brent Simmons of Ranchero Software, author of NetNewsWire, a leading RSS-based application. When the board makes a decision it will be by majority vote.

I think this is a great step toward a peace process in the "great RSS debate". Dan Gillmor [writes about this in more detail](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001195.shtml#001195) on his blog.

I think we should call a cease-fire at this point...
