I've been thinking about how I am going to use [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com/). [Boris mentioned the permalink issue](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/07/09/typepad_is_a_go.html#n008185) of switching, but I think we could probably solve that. However, I am leaning toward keeping my main blog on [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) so I can hack it directly and run [bots](http;//joi.ito.com/joiwiki/TechnoBot) and stuff. I think this site just needs a serious overhaul. There are a lot of cool features on TypePad that deal with non-text content and metadata so I'm thinking of moving my audblog, moblog, photos and my "reviews" over to [my TypePad](http://joi.typepad.com) site. Anyway, I'll be messing around for awhile.

I am going to stop cross posting between this blog and TypePad because it is confusing. I was with [Mena](http://www.dollarshort.org/) last week and she helped me answer "gee, I wonder what my site would look like on TypePad?" I couldn't resist the opportunity to have template-master-Mena design my site. ;-)

Anyway, feedback is appreciated as I try to figure out how to make all this work together. Also, please remember that TypePad is still in beta. Lots of features and documentation still to come so please be patient.
