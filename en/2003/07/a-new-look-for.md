[Boris](http://bopuc.levendis.com/RowBoat/) aka Bopuc has been working on fixing the look and making the page more valid based on lots of feedback I've received. It's still a first pass and we are going to work on the navigation and other things, but let us know what you think.

Please post feeback on [wiki page](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/JoiItoComDesign) if possible.
