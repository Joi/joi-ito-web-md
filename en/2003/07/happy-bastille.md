Lots of Cheese and other goodies at the French Embassy Bastille Day Party this evening. I have no idea who invited me, and I was worried that I wouldn't know anyone. Luckily I knew a few people and got to chat with [Idei-san](http://joi.ito.com/moblog/archives/005921.html). We talked about blogs. I asked him to be my guest blogger.

Happy Bastille Day!
