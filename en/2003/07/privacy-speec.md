[![](http://joi.ito.com/images/privvendspeech-tm.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/images/privvendspeech.jpg)Yesterday, I gave a talk to approximately 150 IT vendors who will be installing the national ID systems at the local government offices and will the the "privacy advisors" to the local governments.

Almost a year ago, [I was handing out leaflets and protesting with a megaphone in Ginza](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/08/04/rally_against_the_national_id.html) to try to stop the national ID. Then the bill passed and I joined the [oversight committee for the national ID](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/08/23/ministrys_efforts_to_coopt_me.html) to try to increase their awareness of security and privacy issues. Then I started [working with the local governments who "opted out"](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/04/28/meeting_with_mayor_nakada_of_yokohama_and_first_meeting_of_personal_information_protection_committee.html) of the national ID. Now that the system is in place full swing, I am working hard to increase the awareness of the people who will be installing and training the people who are in charge of one of the weakest links in the system, the point of entry into the database. At the same time, I am working on [educating the ministry and the awareness in the public](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/PrivacyReport) so that we can prevent "function drift", or the use of the national ID # beyond the scope of its original intent, which is to use it only for government services.

I am supportive of my colleagues who are still working on protesting the system and local governments resisting it, but I am focusing my attention on future systems that the government is planning to implement and to try to do what I can to improve the security and privacy of those systems that have already been deployed or will imminently be deployed.
