I've set up [a wiki page](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/StrategicHeckleCommand) to try to heckle conferences more strategically. We should post information about conferences we are going to remote-heckle, list of speakers, past presentations from the speakers, what they are likely to speak about, hard questions we should ask, etc.
