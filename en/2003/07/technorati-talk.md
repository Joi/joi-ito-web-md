[Technorati](http://www.technorati.com) reads the FOAF file from your blog and creates [a profile](http://www.technorati.com/profile/joichi). Your picture from your FOAF file and a link to your profile shows up when you appear in people's cosmos listings. A good reason to get a FOAF file. [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com) has FOAF built in. If you want to build a FOAF file, you can go to [this foaf-a-matic site](http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic.html) (thanks for the link [Sifry](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/)) and make a FOAF file. Put the FOAF file on a server and point to in from your blog with a link tag like this:
> <link rel="meta" type="application/rdf+xml" title="FOAF" href="http://joi.ito.com/foaf.rdf" />

*FOAF stands for "Friend of a Friend" and it is [a project](http://rdfweb.org/foaf/) to create a machine readable format for putting information about yourself and your friends on web pages.*

Here's [Marc Canter's profile](http://www.technorati.com/profile/marccanter)

Update: As Dave Sifry says in the comments section, you must get an account on Technorati and "claim your blog" before it will make a profile from your FOAF. You can do that [here](http://www.technorati.com/members/claimblog.html).
