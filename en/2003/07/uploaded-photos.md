I just scanned and uploaded to [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com/), my [photos](http://joi.typepad.com/photos/1imc/) from the [First International Moblogging Conference](http://www.marginwalker.org/1imc.html).

Photos taken with a Hasselblad 503CW with a CFE 80/2.8 lense and a Hasselblad D-flash 40 on Fujicolor New Pro400 negative film. Images were scanned with a Nikon Super Coolscan 8000.
