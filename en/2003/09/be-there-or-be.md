> As part of our first trip to New York City, we are inviting everyone to join us in [Madison Square Park](http://www.madisonsquarepark.org/park.asp#), right near the Flatiron Building in Manhattan, on Saturday September 13th from 2pm to 4pm. Of course, it being New York City, Anil will be there, and our good friend and partner Joi Ito has promised to show up as well.
