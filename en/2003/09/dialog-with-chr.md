[![](http://joi.ito.com/images/chrisly-tm.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/images/chrisly.jpg)Christopher Lydon and I had a discussion this morning. He's [posted the audio file on his blog.](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/lydon/2003/09/10#a308) Chris and I totally "clicked".

Chris is originally a radio talk show host on public radio who moved to the Internet. I'm honored to be on his interviewee roll. He's a great example of audio blogging and is pushing the envelop. It's great seeing more and more professionals like Chris embracing the medium.

I'd originally heard about Chris from [Dave](http://www.scripting.com), and he's as cool as advertised. Check out [his site](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/lydon/). He's putting a voice behind a lot of the bloggers which adds another dimension to our identities online.

UPDATE: I asked Chris to talk the radio show he used to have on NPR

> Mary McGrath and I made a little radio miracle. We called it The Connection and public stations in 75 American cities picked it up. It was two hours every day of ridiculously energetic call-in conversation about everything--starting with politics, books, poetry, music, philosophy, fantasy, humor. We had a short-story writing context, and a haiku contest. Toni Morrison, Yo-Yo Ma, Norman Mailer, Salman Rushdie, Yevtushenko, Seamus Heaney, Seiji Ozawa, Bill Clinton imitators, E. O. Wilson--you name them; the most interesting people in American life made our show their gymasium, and loved it. Somebody said: you treat your guests like callers and your callers like guests. When NPR came around to syndicate the show two years ago, we told the producing station we wanted a stake. The station signed the NPR deal without mention of us, then threw us out of the building. It was ugly, a custody fight, really, over a child we'd raised to glory together. They cut the baby in half. Mary and I will make another miracle yet.
