FCCster is "A P2P tool for sharing FrequenCy Control fallacies."
> FCCster Operational Goals
>
> Operational Goals   
> -- Using [completely public tools](http://www.seedwiki.com/page.cfm?doc=OutOfBand%20WiFi%20Standards&wikiid=3098), promote interoperability within the additional data channels to be found in the most accessible Wi-Fi pirate bands  
> -- Convince the telecom finance industry that businesses dependent on new spectrum auctions and allocations can never again generate positive investment returns  
> -- FCCster will not promote or condone illegal radio use but believes that its short-term inevitability creates an inescapable social responsibility to promote realism, education, and reform

They are trying to coordinate the development of pirate radio equipment to be interoperable. I'm not sure if this is necessarily the right approach to put pressure on the FCC and whether this is a "good thing." It is however pretty interesting and is probably as inevitable as music file sharing...
