| Martin Nisenholtz, CEO - New York Times Digital |

Met Martin Nisenholtz and Catherine Levene of New York Times Digital yesterday. Martin is the CEO of NYTd and Catherine is the VP of Strategy & Business Development. Martin and Catherine are the two behind the [NYT RSS feed for Userland](http://radio.userland.com/newYorkTimes). I was expecting to have to go through my usual song and dance about blogging, but I realized quickly that I was preaching to the choir and that they already "got it". We quickly switched gears to talking about what happens next. We talked about the impact of blogging on democracy and journalism as well as the technology of blogging. It was really a treat to talk to professional journalists who were thinking seriously about blogging. The New York Times is lucky to have these two and I hope they are successful in truly digitalizing the New York Times.

Won't it be great when media like the New York Times can work with bloggers and allow things that percolate up through the blogs make it into the New York Times? I think that a combination of real sources in some of the hard to reach areas of the world together with NGO bloggers and other caring enthusiasts could really help media like the New York Times reach out further and get around the resource constraint issues that [Richard Smith of Newsweek talked about in Geneva](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/09/06/world_affairs_newsweek_editorial_panel.html). In addition, finding and pointing to voices like [Salam Pax](http://dear_raed.blogspot.com/) in other parts of the world can help people in attaching a personal perspective and maybe get people to care more about far away cultures.
