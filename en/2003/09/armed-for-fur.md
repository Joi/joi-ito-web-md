| Browsing on my DCR-IP7 Video Camera through Hirata's Docomo PHS 663S via bluetooth |

Went looking for a small video camera for my continuing pursuit of [stealth disco](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/09/17/stealth_disco.html) excellence. I found a [Sony DCR-IP7](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0108/01082001sonymvcamcorders.asp). It uses the tiny micro Cassette Memory, has IP, a browser, bluetooth and a bunch of other stuff you'd never need for a stealth disco camera, but it was released in 2001 and I got it at a discount. It was the smallest video camera I could find.

I haven't used it yet to take video, but we were able to connect it via bluetooth to Hirata's PHS mobile phone and connect to the Net and browse the web. Very cool, but almost completely useless. ;-)
