Steven Johnson, the author of [Emergence](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684868768/qid=1064870483/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/002-2703789-2178460), (the book that inspired me to start thinking about [Emergent Democracy](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/EmergentDemocracy)) [recently blogged](http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/movabletype/archives/000105.html) about grassroots political ads created with desktop tools. He created a cool [quicktime mock ad](http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/clarkversusbush.mov) for the Clark campaign and later Sean created [a version with music and voiceover](http://thechurchhouse.com/movies/clarkversusbushmusicvo.mov). Steven created this with iPhoto and Keynote.

Very cool use of desktop technology and weblogs. I hope we see a lot more of this stuff. I particularly like the collaborative aspect. Steven, you should put a [creative commons](http://www.creativecommons.org) license on your ad. ;-)
