> The Hungarian immigrant known as the "father of the H-bomb" died at his home on the Stanford University campus in California Tuesday. [Link](http://wireservice.wired.com/wired/story.asp?section=Breaking&storyId=780633)

I remember interviewing Edward Teller for a high school paper that I was writing about the A-Bomb. I remember my teacher not believing that I had actually interviewed him. We knew him because he was a good friend of the company that my parents and later I worked for, [ECD](http://www.ovonic.com/). He had written a book about atomic power which was ready to go to print. He heard about the solar technology we were working on at ECD. He had discounted solar energy in the book, but he came to visit ECD to make sure he was right. After we convinced him that we were further ahead in solar technology than he thought, he stopped the press and changed his comments in his book. His integrity with respect to scientific facts was very impressive, even if I didn't agree with his politics.

I also had the opportunity to talk to him several times over the years and found him to be a very curious, neotenous, genius who had made a choice to build the H-Bomb based on his fear of the Russians based on his experience. I will miss him.
