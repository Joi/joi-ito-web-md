I have 2 more meetings and I'm on my way back to Tokyo. It's been a hectic trip but a fun trip, but I'm glad to be headed home. In the last 2 weeks I've been to Geneva, Menorca, Barcelona, Boston, Wood Holes, New York, Detroit and San Francisco. I feel like a blog salesman. I remember walking through LaGuardia airport and not being able to remember what city I was in. It reminded me of some scene in some movie, but I can't remember the movie.

Thanks to everyone who helped make my trip a great one and apologizes to people I missed on this trip. See you all the next time around.
