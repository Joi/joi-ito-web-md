Although the [Republican National Committee denies it](http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=34390), The Business Standard in India [reports](http://www.business-standard.com/archives/2003/jan/50310103.016.asp) that the Republicans are outsourcing campaign fund-raising to India. The new law in the US allows people to opt out of telemarketing from everyone except political parties and non-profits. If the RNC is outsourcing to India, I guess it leaves only the Democrats and non-profits for people who make a living in telemarketing. Bummer.

I didn't realize that Bush was talking about jobs in India. (I personally don't have anything against creating jobs in India...)
