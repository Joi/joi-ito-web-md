> SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - An Internet search company on Thursday filed a $100 million antitrust lawsuit against VeriSign Inc., accusing the Web address provider of hijacking misspelled and unassigned Web addresses with a service it launched this week.

[I blogged earlier about SiteFinder](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/09/17/verisign_modifies_the_infrastructure_of_the_net_to_point_back_to_themselves.html) and everyone agreed it was a "bad thing." VeriSign just got sued for it.
