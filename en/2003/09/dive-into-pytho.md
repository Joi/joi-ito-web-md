Mark Pilgrim (aka f8dy on #joiito) [blogs](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/09/17/publishing#comments) that [Dive Into Python](http://diveintopython.org/) is going to be published as a book. [James Cox](http://imajes.info/) (aka imajes on #joiito) will be the editor. This is great news. Dive Into Python is how I learned Python. I've read several other tutorials, but Dive Into Python is the best I've seen. It's also interesting to note that f8dy and imajes met on [#joiito](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel). I was when I was reading Dive Into Python that I went to the #python on [Freenode](http://www.freeenode.net) for help. This inspired me to start #joiito. Kind of circular karma. ;-)
