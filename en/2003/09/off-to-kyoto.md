I'm off to Kyoto for the day to give a talk on [Emergent Democracy](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/EmergentDemocracy). I think the audience is mostly professors and it's a 40 minute talk with 50 minutes of Q&A. Pretty long Q&A. It should be fun, but I'm sure I'm going to be ripped to shreds. ;-)

There are some other interesting speakers. If I have wireless access, I'll be on [IRC](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel) and will try to post the interesting thoughts.

UPDATE: My wireless card works so I'm going to drop into [IRC](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel) sometime between 0430 and 0510 GMT/UTC to give a demo...
