The [Dean campaign](http://www.deanforamerica.com/) just [announced](http://www.deanforamerica.com/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=9432&JServSessionIdr001=pb1lrky7p1.app195a&security=1&news_iv_ctrl=1301) Howard Dean's Internet Initiative.

I will be participating in the Net Advisory Net and I am in [good company](http://www.deanforamerica.com/technology_profile).
> [The Net Advisory Net](http://www.deanforamerica.com/NAN)

The Net Advisory Net will present to the Governor and his team diverse and highly-informed opinions concerning the Internet and its potential impact upon society. While many of the members support Dean, he is seeking advice, not endorsements, and the advisors do not necessary support the campaign. Learn more at http://www.deanforamerica.com/NAN.

The first NAN team will focus on how to bridge the "digital divide" by providing universal broadband access to the Internet. Initial members of the broadband committee include: Hal Abelson, Laura Breeden, DeWayne Hendricks, Joi Ito, Lawrence Lessig, Bob Lucky, David Reed, Richard Rowe and David Weinberger. Other working groups will be established to address the potential of e-government to increase our democracy, balancing the rights of artists and the public domain, protecting the privacy of customers and citizens, electronic voting, protecting children and vulnerable communities from Internet exploitation, and controlling spam without impeding the basic architecture of the Web. The goal of each working group will be to frame issues and hold conversations about public policies in order to prepare specific suggestions for the Governor to consider and proposals for addressing these issues in a Dean administration.I think the Dean campaign's involvement of the Internet could revolutionize the way politics and democracy work. I'm excited to be part of the team and am very interested in how this ties into [emergent democracy](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/EmergentDemocracy). I'm also looking forward to taking what we learn and bringing it back to Japan.

There is [a less boastful and better post](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002026.html) about this with a bunch of links on David Weinberger's blog.
