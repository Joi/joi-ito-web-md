I received a link from Chris to a fanimutation called [Irrational Exuberance](http://www.verylowsodium.com/fanimutation/exuberance.php) by Veloso at [verylowsodium.com](http://www.verylowsodium.com/). It's very funny. It's a flash animation over the Happatai song "Yatta!". [Max and James](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/05/23/thanks_max_and_james.html) turned me on to "Yatta!" When I saw them in May at FiRe. Happatai are a group of Japanese comedians who [released a song back in April 2001](http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005HYAY/qid%3D1063621951/250-3988090-7341862) called "Yatta!". It's a very silly song with silly lyrics and a video of them dancing around with no clothes and just a fig leaf. The weird thing about this is that it was slightly funny when it came out in Japan, but the mpeg video of this has been zooming around the Internet in the US and has developed small cult following. this fanimutation by Veloso is just another "derivative work" of "Yatta!" I wonder if this is an example of [Japan's Gross National Cool](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/08/06/japans_gross_national_cool.html) export. Maybe I should contact them and see if they will release the rights for these fanimutations since they are clearly increasing their popularity in the US. ;-)

Flash animations over popular or weird songs or "fanimutations" are becoming a funky new art form. People seem to encourage sharing of the flash code. They are another example of a new form of "art" like mashups that aren't really feasible under traditional copyright/licensing. Mixing, sharing and attribution are at the core of this new subculture. If you go to the sites, you'll notice that people go to great lengths to link and attribute.
