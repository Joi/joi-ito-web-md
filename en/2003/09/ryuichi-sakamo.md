| Ryuichi Sakamoto |

Went to Ryuichi Sakamoto's place yesterday. I don't get to see him very often since he moved from Tokyo back to New York. Ryuichi is one of my favorite musician/activists and is a great inspiration to me. He's very smart and is called  *kyoju* (professor in Japanese) by his friends and is always thinking and studying. He's an outspoken anti-war activist and an environmentalist. I met [Ryu Murakami](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/10/11/ryu_murakami_visited_today.html) through Ryuichi. Ryuichi was also responsible for getting me involved with the effort to invite the [Dalai Lama](http://www.friends-of-tibet.org.nz/dlama.html) to Japan. (They are good friends.)

The last time I saw him, we were both using Windows machines and this time we both had 15" Powerbooks. I showed off [TraktorDJStudio](http://www.native-instruments.com/) and gave my blogging spiel. Ryuichi has [a cool web page](http://www.sitesakamoto.com/) and is on [a blog called codeblog](http://www.metamix.com/code/) but I tried to convince him to dive into it himself and get the full blown blogging community experience. I walked him through the tools and my favorite sites. Ryuichi sends out emails to a list several times a week with his thoughts on the environment and war and I think that having a strong voice in the blog space would be really cool for him.

I also got to see Sora-san and Neo again. The last time I saw Neo, he was still a little kid. It made me feel old seeing him so big. ;-)
