> WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean has asked former NATO commander Wesley Clark to join his campaign if Clark does not run himself and the two have discussed the vice presidency, The Washington Post reported on Thursday.

This is good news. I'd love to see this duo in the Whitehouse.

I saw Wesley Clark at Brainstorm and at FiRE and was really impressed by him. I wonder if he's going to accept the offer...
