[![](http://joi.ito.com/images/weflogo-tm.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/images/weflogo.jpg)Today is the third and final day of the [World Economic Forum Global Leaders for Tomorrow Annual Summit](http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/Global+Leaders+for+Tomorrow+%28GLTs%29). This is one of my favorite events of the year and this year is the best one so far. This annual summit is a meeting dedicated to the GLT's. The GLT's are 100 people under the age of 37 from all over the world in a variety of fields who are chosen by the Forum every year. They are invited to the annual meeting in Davos, but also to this special summit in Geneva in the fall. Davos is pretty hectic and the staff are very busy with the main program so it a bit difficult to focus. This annual summit is great because the only the GLT's are here and the participants are the active members of the last 5 "classes" of GLT's. It's a great way to meet a huge variety of really interesting people you'd never get a chance to meet. Also, since you get back together every year for 5 years, you get to build a fairly special relationship with some of the other members.

The sessions so far have been great. I attended a workshop on wisdom and one on creativity. I'll blog about them in a few minutes.

Today, we're going to spend the morning with the Social Entrepreneurs. [They chose eleven social entrepreneurs for 2004](http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/Schwab+Foundation+Selects+Outstanding+Social+Entrepreneurs+for+2004). "The eleven were chosen as outstanding examples of people who have identified practical solutions to social problems by combining innovation, resourcefulness and opportunity. Whether their organizations are constituted as ‘for profit’ or ‘not-for-profit’, their primary goal is social value creation."

I know all of this sounds a bit "exclusive" and I guess it is. However, It's amazingly valuable to me and I think potentially a very good thing. Building ties with people in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia. I come away feeling personally responsible for issues that I never thought concerned me. When [Bill Clinton](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/07/30/bill_clintons_speech.html) talked about poverty, Africa and the Middle East in his speech, it was impressive, but when you realize you have friends there who are working, struggling, fighting, the issues become much "closer to home."
