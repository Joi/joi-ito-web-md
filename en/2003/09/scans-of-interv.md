[Tom Coates](http://www.plasticbag.org) has a friend ([Simon Waldman](http://wow.blogs.com/words/)) who found an [old copy of Home and Gardens with an interview with Hitler](http://wow.blogs.com/photos/hitler/ahcover.html). Very cool. I wonder if someone will mirror it before it gets taken down. ;-)
