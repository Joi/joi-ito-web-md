Verisign has rigged all .com and .net mistyped domains to reroute to their [branded search page](http://sitefinder.verisign.com/). This makes them effectively the [biggest cybersquatter](http://www.verisign.com/resources/gd/sitefinder/implementation.pdf) on the net, and will make it impossible for most spam filters at the network level to operate as well as seriously [complicating](http://www.verisign.com/resources/gd/sitefinder/bestpractices.pdf) the lives of network administrators everywhere.

I wonder if someone at Verisign thought this was a clever hack. It's stupid stuff like this that makes it very clear to everyone that Verisign is in a position to abuse their power.
