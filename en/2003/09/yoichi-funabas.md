Right on [Gen](http://www.kanai.net/weblog/archives/001399.html). [Rock on Funabashi-san](http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/commentary/story/0,4386,210801,00.html). I [met Yoichi Funabashi back in May 2000](http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/commentary/story/0,4386,210801,00.html). He was getting started on the "make English Japan's second language" thing, which I was obviously extremely supportive of. ;-)

Yoichi Funabashi's a smart, balanced guy we should listen to who can speak/write in English. We should get this man a blog...
