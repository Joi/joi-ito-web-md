So many people have already blogged this so I don't know who to attribute, but if you missed it, check out [Stealth Disco](http://69.49.199.91/best_of.asp). Stealth disco is when you take video tape yourself or someone rocking and grooving near someone who can't see you doing it. It started as a prank between employees at an ad agency in Chicago called [Cramer-Krasselt](http://www.c-k.com).
