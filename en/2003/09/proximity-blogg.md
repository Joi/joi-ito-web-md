I was sitting next to [Cory](http://www.boingboing.net/) yesterday. Today I'm sitting next to [David Weinberger](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/). When I sit next to someone, I sit around and read their blog, inevitably leading to finding something interesting on the blog that I need to blog about. Obvious, but interesting on this warm, balmy day.
