I'm off to Geneva today to attend the [World Economic Forum Global Leaders for Tomorrow Annual Summit](http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/Global+Leaders+for+Tomorrow+%28GLTs%29). After that, I'm off to Menorca for a retreat, then off to a Boston via Barcelona. One night in Boston and off to another retreat nearby. I'm dropping by New York for the weekend and off to [ECD](http://www.ovonic.com) in Michigan. Two nights in Michigan and off to SF for 24 hours and back here again. I feel like a UUCP email message. Apologies in advance to people I will be missing this trip. It's a pretty hectic trip and I'm already tired just looking at my schedule which is nicely booked in 1-2 hour meetings for the whole trip without a single party...
I hope to make a more leisurely trip to the US with more party time soon.
