Dan Gillmor [blogs](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001360.shtml) about another person losing their job for blogging. Every HR person should read [Halley's A Blogger In Their Midst](http://www.halleyscomment.blogspot.com/2003_08_17_halleyscomment_archive.html#106155772023135567) and every PR person should read [the cluetrain manifesto](http://www.cluetrain.com/) and every editor should read [Dan's book](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000924.shtml#000924) when it comes out. There is definitely a rift between the "gets" and the "get nots". Having said that, "getting it" is non-trivial and I think we're inventing it as we go along. A lot of people will probably lose their jobs and many others will find new ones as we push the envelope.

I just hope my employees don't sue me for being [stealth disco'ed](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/09/22/my_first_stealth_disco.html).
