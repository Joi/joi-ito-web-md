Sifry [has just added a new API call](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000309.html) to [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/) called getinfo. It lets you get information that a blogger has made available about themselves on their blog like a link to their FOAF file, LOAF file or their GeoURL. The great thing about this is if you've [claimed](http://www.technorati.com/members/claimblog.html) your blog, this is a verifiable way to link your Technorati ID with your blog. LOTS of amazing things this could enable... (There will be a quiz at the end.)

So... who's going to program [jibot](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/JiBot) to retrieve people's Technorati info?

Here is how to get my getinfo <http://api.technorati.com/getinfo?username=joichi>
