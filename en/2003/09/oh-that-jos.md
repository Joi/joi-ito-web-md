When I was in New York, I met [Britt Blaser](http://www.blaserco.com/blogs) and [Josh Koenig](http://outlandishjosh.com/). They came to the [Six Apart meeting](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/09/06/be_there_or_be_square_blogmob_in_madison_square_park.html). They are both working on the [Dean campaign](http://www.deanforamerica.com/) and it was great talking to them. I had seen both of their names online and I tried to store their faces in the approximate location in my brain of where I thought I had remembered seeing them online. Then when I was reading [an entry on Britt's blog](http://www.blaserco.com/blogs/2003/09/16.html#a200) about how much fun they were all having working on the campaign, I clicked thru to Josh and remembered Josh was Outlandish Josh. I was on the phone with [David Kirkpatrick](http://joi.typepad.com/photos/brainstorm2003/cimg0004.html) of Fortune yesterday so Fortune magazine was fresh in my mind. I remembered that I met someone at the [Fortune conference in Aspen](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/07/27/off_to_aspen_to_attend_fortuneaspen_institutes_brainstorm_2003_.html) who was a "friend of Josh, Outlandish Josh." A few more synapses fired and now Josh has unique spot in my brain. The problem is, I remember people mostly by their first name and there are also [Josh](http://www.zenarchery.com/) and [Josh](http://memepool.com/). There are way [too many Daves](http://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/poetry/poems/tooManyDaves.html) and surely a lot of Ross's. Lots of neuronal name space collisions. On IRC people naturally pick nicknames so there are no name collisions and I find it convenient to remember and refer to people by their IRC nicknames. (Although it's a pain when they contain non alpha-numeric characters.)

I wonder if there is any way for social software to help me remember people and keep them sorted and in context in my brain... Maybe photo albums, my own blog and links to other blogs is maybe the best way. I wonder if I should make a search engine for my own blog instead of using Google so I can sort comments by person and display inbound and outbound links, link to Technorati ID's and other cool things. Maybe I can get [Jibot](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/JiBot) to help...
