John Markoff introduced me to Scott Love over the Net. He is the man behind the amazing outliner [NoteTaker](http://www.aquaminds.com/index.jsp). Markoff is using NoteTaker. I have this funny thing with Markoff because he won't blog. I think Markoff's sense of finding cool people and cool technologies is amazing though. He was the one who gave me MacPPP when it first came out and it was one of the key elements in dragging me back into networked computing again after a lull in the late 80's. Anyway, when John tells me I "need to meet" someone, I do.

Scott is great. So is NoteTaker. First of all, I have become TOTALLY addicted to NoteTaker. I throw EVERYTHING into it. Photos of people, sounds, URL's, clippings, PDF's, etc. I can sort them, organize them, annotate them, index them, create to do's and publish them in OPML, as web pages or as mail attachments to others using NoteTaker. So, when I met the man behind NoteTaker via email and eventually in person, I realized that this was no ordinary piece of software but something written by someone who had a big plan, but was willing to take a lot of feedback and build it into the product. I've been talking to Scott about a lot of feature requests and thoughts on where things might go. Suffice it to say that he "gets it."

So, I'm excited that maybe NoteTaker will be a way to get some convergence between us and the non-blogging world. NoteTaker has a great interface and does many things... If you haven't tried the product, take it for a spin and IMAGINE... ;-)
