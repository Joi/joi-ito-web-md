[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/swjoi-thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/swjoi1.html)Taiichi Fox brought a Segway over to the office today and let us take it for a spin. It was great. It is one of the two Segways that I know about in Japan. He brought it from the US. I'm still trying to figure out whether to leave mine in the US or have it delivered to Japan. Japan is definitely more suited for Segways but we're not allowed to ride them yet. I'm [applying for a regulatory waiver](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/01/26/segways_for_japan.html), but the first one was rejected. I'm applying for it again in June. I think I should probably leave mine in Silicon Valley to cruise around when I'm there and bring mine to Japan once we are allowed to cruise freely.

Anyway, it was lots of fun and perfect for people who have to walk 30 minutes to the train station every day.
