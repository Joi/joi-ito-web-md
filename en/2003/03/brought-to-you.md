At the party, [Gnome Girl](http://www.gnome-girl.com/), [Chris](http://chris.pirillo.com/) and I were talking about how it would be cool to have personal icons in the blogroll. We went over to [Jason](http://jason.defillippo.com/blog/) of [Blogrolling.com](http://www.blogrolling.com/) and begged him to include it. . Mr. [150 MPH Chris](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/03/03#partyNotes), made me a [favicon](http://www.favicon.com/) "J" which, if you are using a compliant browser, should be visible. Thanks Chris! I don't remember for sure, but I think it was Gnome Girl who suggested that maybe icons should also show up when you post on other people's blogs... Everything I talked about at the party is a bit blurry... Anyway, this is fun. Thanks for my "J" Chris!
