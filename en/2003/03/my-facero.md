How do you like my new faceroll? It's on in my left sidebar. Jason explains how to do it [here](http://jason.defillippo.com/blog/archives/000336.phtml). You have to be a paying member of [Blogrolling.com](http://www.blogrolling.com) to use it. I have mine set up to pick 5 people randomly. If you see your picture and you don't want to be in the faceroll or have another picture you'd rather I used, let me know.
