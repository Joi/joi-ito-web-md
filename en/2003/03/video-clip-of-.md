[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/davodpanel-thumb.jpeg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/davodpanel.html)So, after [a discussion about fair use and copyright](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/15/fair_use_question_about_uploading_stuff_from_tv.html), I decided to upload a short rant that I did on the [panel in Davos about the Blueprint for Japan 2020 this year](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/01/24/davos_blueprint_for_japan_2020_panel.html). It is [a QT .mov file and is 4MB](http://joi.ito.com/static/davospanel.mov). It was taped from an NHK broadcast of a Davos special. The audio is stereo with Japanese on the left channel and English on the right.
