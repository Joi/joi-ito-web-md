![coronavirus.jpg](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/coronavirus.jpg)[I reported earlier](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/22/sars_virus_identified_no_easy_cure_but_not_so_infectious.html) that the situation with the killer pneumonia was getting better, but it looks like it's getting worse. [AP reports](http://abcnews.go.com/wire/Living/ap20030327_1000.html) that over 1000 people in Hong Kong have been quarantined and travel alerts are increasing. [The WHO has called on countries to screen international air travelers for symptoms.](http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=DC20726D-D4C7-495F-B7013E1154BE2258)

UPDATE: [BBC reports](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2891467.stm) that they've probably identifed the virus and it's called the Corona virus. *[via Marc's Voice](http://blogs.it/0100198/2003/03/27.html)*
