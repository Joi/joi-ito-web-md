[Anil](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php) [coins a new smiley](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?archives/005433.php). :|

Have a day everyone...

*PS Anil is not nearly as annoying in person as he is online. When I met him at [my party](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/04/making_room_for_more_new_friends.html) I was suprised by how warm and friendly he was. Later I started introducing him to others like this: "Anil is not an asshole but he plays one on TV." He told me that his ability to manage his online personality was his key to success.* [":)"](http://www.umamitsunami.com/)
