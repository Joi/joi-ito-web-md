Yes! I love B&O stuff. I aways buy it and never use it. ;-p I'm so happy with my iPod and my [Shure E5c's](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/01/shure_e5c_im_in_sound_heaven.html#004272) that I'm not sure where this BeSound2 would fit into my lifestyle, but it just looks sooo cool. Maybe I can use the BeSound2 when the iPod is out of battery power or when I have to wear an mp3 player at [a dinner party](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/19/dinner_with_the_swiss_ambassador_to_japan_jacques_reverdin.html)...
