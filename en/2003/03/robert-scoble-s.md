[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/birthplacesv-thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/birthplacesv.html)Had dinner last night with [Robert Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/03/09.html#a2443), Maryam, and [Dave Winer](http://www.scripting.com/) at Dave's favorite Thai restaurant. Really fun discussion, albeit a bit geeky. Dave explained that Robert was a "local boy" who grew up in Silicon Valley. Through the dinner, I could tell that Robert was very proud of Silicon Valley. The dynamic between Dave and Robert was great and very educational for me in understanding the spirit of Silicon Valley.

After dinner, Robert took me to see the "birthplace of Silicon Valley." As the plaque says, it was the garage where Hewlett and Packard started their business instead of going to the East Coast to work for a big company. The plaque mentions Dr. Terman, a Stanford University professor who encouraged his students to set up their own companies instead of going to work for big East Coast firms. The plaque was in front of a rather ordinary house and it took us a while to find it. ;-)
