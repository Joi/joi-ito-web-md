So here is a great example of why we need to be [able to link to stuff and not be endorsing them.](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/14/adding_more_information_to_links.html) From the Goldblogger website (Whuffie=thumbsdown http://www.goldblogger.com/):

> "You can't make money blogging."

How many times have you heard that?

If you are like me, it's once too often!

Who are these idiots that are making these wild claims? Not one of them can offer proof or facts to back up their statements.

But here is the truth.

I am making money with my blogs and so are the big names in the blogging community:

[Rebecca Blood](http://www.rebeccablood.net "Rebecca's Pocket!")  
[Nick Denton](http://www.nickdenton.org/)  
[Glenn Reynolds](http://www.instapundit.com "Instapundit!")  
[Andrew Sullivan](http://www.andrewsullivan.com "Daily Dish!")  
[Dave Winer](http://www.scripting.com "Scripting News!")

All of them are accomplished writers and command a large and devoted audience of readers. But it is their entrepreneurialism that sets them apart. I call them GoldBloggers!*Via [Chris Pirillo](http://chris.pirillo.com/archives/2003_03.html#004248). So Chris, how did YOU find this site? Were you googling for "make money blogging"? ;-)*
