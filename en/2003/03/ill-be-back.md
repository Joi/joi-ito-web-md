Dave [quotes MacArthur](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/03/10#When:8:33:13AM) and says, "I shall return." I'll use a more modern quote... "I'll be back." Thank you Silicon Valley for getting me buzzed again. I will definitely be back soon. (I'll throw another party too.) In [his latest essay](http://davenet.userland.com/2003/03/10/likeMacarthur), Dave says, "These days the Japanese are our friends. Partners in economic misery. Moore's Law continues to rage, but somehow our economies are stuck. I think I know why, it's because intellectually we have gotten lazy." I'm on my way back to Japan today. I will try to wake everyone up and start a buzz there too.

Lets wake up and move on.
