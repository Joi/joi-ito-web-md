I have a fair use question that maybe someone can answer for me. NHK taped and broadcasted the [Blueprint for Japan 2020 panel in Davos](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/01/24/davos_blueprint_for_japan_2020_panel.html). I am one of the speakers. I taped the broadcast and would like to put it on my web page. There are maybe three types of content mixed together. My talking, other people talking, translation into Japanese and some visuals. I guess, strictly speaking, they own the copyright, but what would constitute fair use? In text, I can see quoting it, but how do you quote video?

Also, NHK is a public broadcast company which we have to pay for like a tax. I wonder whether I can try to push them to make stuff like this public domain...

Another totally separate note, they didn't pay me for the panel. I had to pay to go to Davos. I didn't sign any waiver or anything either. What rights do THEY have to broadcast it? Maybe I signed something without noticing it... hmm...
