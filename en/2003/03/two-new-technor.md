[Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/), my favorite blog oriented engine just announced two new services. [Breaking News](http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/breakingnews.html) and [Hot Links](http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/hotlinks.html). Breaking News shows articles from about 4000 "professional" news services that have been published in the last 12 hours that bloggers are talking about. (Take THAT Google News. ;-) )
Hot links shows links that bloggers are talking about in all categories in the past 12 hours in chronological order so you can see what is hot NOW.
Very cool.
