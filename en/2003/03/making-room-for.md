Coming to Silicon Valley is always a good excuse to throw a party. Last time I came, Kara Swisher and Megan Smith hosted the party at their house and it was great. (Thanks again Kara and Megan!) This time, I decided that I should probably invite more people so we had it at a restaurant called Zibibbo in Palo Alto.

I think about 150 people showed up. The criteria for invitation was that I invited old friends, friends who came to the [spectrum conference at Stanford](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/spectrum/) and new friends I have met over my blog. People were also allowed to invite their friends. Interestingly, 150 is the magic number from *The Tipping Point* of how many people you can have a real social relationship with...

Anyway, it turned into a great party because not only did many of my old friends and new friends show up, but I made even more friends because everyone brought their friends. So... where do I put all of these new friends?

I just revamped my blogroll. I dumped blogs which were not being updated frequently, blogs I wasn't reading and obvious sites that I don't have a personal relationship with. I added blogs that I have recently begun to read and blogs of my new friends I've met either physically, in the comments section of my blog or through the [emergent democracy happening](http://topicexchange.com/t/emergent_democracy/). Now my blogroll reflects my network of friends instead of some ranking of popular blogs. You can go to [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com) for that.

I would like to apologize to anyone who I forgot to invite. I have a very bad memory and this was sort of an emergent party. I'm sure I'll have another one soon. If you want to get invited, just post comments on my blog a lot. ;-)

There are some bloggers who have written about the party: [Chris Pirillo](http://chris.pirillo.com/archives/2003_03.html#004096), [Gnome Girl](http://www.gnome-girl.com/archives/000978.html), [Jason Defillippo here](http://jason.defillippo.com/blog/archives/000252.phtml) and [here](http://jason.defillippo.com/blog/archives/000255.phtml), [Dave Winer](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/03/03#partyNotes), [Marc Canter here](http://blogs.it/0100198/2003/03/03.html), [here](http://blogs.it/0100198/2003/03/03.html#a743) and [here](http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/2003/03/04.html#a808), [Kazuya Minami](http://blog.neoteny.com/minami/archives/004308.html#004308), [Frank Boosman](http://www.boosman.com/blog/2003_03_01_blogarchive.html#90402237), [Robert Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/03/03.html#a2414), [Ross Mayfield](http://radio.weblogs.com/0114726/2003/03/03.html#a315), [Kevin Marks](http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_03_01_epeus_archive.html#90403884), [Doc Searls](http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/03/03#fundayMorning), [Andrew Kimpton](http://home.awkward.org/blog/archives/000029.html)

But... parties are never as fun to read about when you weren't there, I know...
