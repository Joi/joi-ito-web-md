[![mecorca4.jpg](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/mecorca4.jpg)](http://homepage.mac.com/joi_ito/PhotoAlbum6.html)I just [published my pictures](http://homepage.mac.com/joi_ito/PhotoAlbum6.html) from [Menorca](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/09/17/menorca.html) on .mac so you can finally see them without a password. Sorry, old news, but published well for the first time. I had them on Yahoo, but I guess Yahoo requires you to have an account. That's silly.

The photos were taken with my Hasselblad 205 FCC and a FE 60-120 Lense, scanned into a PhotoCD and uploaded to .mac from iPhoto.
