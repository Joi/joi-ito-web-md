Just like geeks have a [geek code](http://www.geekcode.com/), bloggers now have a blogger code. Mine is: B9 d+ t+ k++ s u f++ i++ o+ x-- e+ l c--

[Here](http://www.leatheregg.com/bloggercode/) is is a site to generate your code and [here](http://www.code9.com/bloggercode/) is a site to decode it.

The only question that was a bit difficult to answer was, "Does longevity equal respect in the blogging world? How long have you been regularly maintaining a personal web log or online journal?"

I have been posting journal-like entries on my web page since 1994, but I moved my site to joi.ito.com and started using Movable Type last June... I answered the question "Over 3 Years." but that might be wrong since I wouldn't tell people I've been blogging for more than three years. I guess this is the whole "what is a blog?" question. What do you think?

UPDATE: [here's another decoder](http://travis.kroh.net/blogger_decoder/)
