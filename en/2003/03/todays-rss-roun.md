Very early on, [Howard](http://www.smartmobs.com/) warned me not to blog about the news that people will see in other places. I think this is very good advice generally. I've gotten some feedback about some of the stuff I've posted which seems to be heavily blogged already (showing up on [Daypop](http://www.daypop.com/) and [Blogdex](http://blogdex.media.mit.edu/)). It appears many people haven't seen it yet and appreciate pointers to important stuff, even if it is a bit late. So, I'm going to write short "roundups" of links to things that bloggers seem to think are important. Heavy bloggers can ignore these.

Comments on the format and this idea would be appreciated.
