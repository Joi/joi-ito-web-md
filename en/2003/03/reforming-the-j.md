Just got out of a meeting of the [Association of Corporate Executives](http://www.doyukai.or.jp/E_index.htm) or the *Keizaidoyukai* where I am a secretariat member and was the youngest member when I joined. The *Keizaidoyukai* is one of the two most powerful economic associations in Japan. The other one is the [Japan Business Federation](http://www.keidanren.or.jp/english/profile/pro001.html) or the *Keidanren*. The *Keidanren* is the federation of all of the big companies, the members representing their companies. The *Keizaidoyukai* represents individual corporate executives. The *Keidanren* is more powerful, but the *Keizaidoyukai* has played a very important role in the past in pushing for reform. The *Keizaidoyukai* was founded after the war by a group of visionary business leaders in their 30's to rebuild Japan. It has grown into a large organization with over a thousand members and an average age of 66 years old.

Tony Kobayashi, the chairman of Fuji-Xerox is the chairman, but his term will end next month and is most likely going to be succeeded by Kakutaro Kitashiro, the chairman of IBM Japan. I'm a big fan of [Tony Kobayashi](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/11/01/talk_at_doyukai.html) and Mr. Kitashiro is someone I greatly respect. I should be overjoyed that Mr. Kitashiro is taking over the *Keizaidoyukai* but today we had a meeting with him and I was quite negative. I felt a bit bad, but I told the group that I was considering resigning because I was frustrated with the lack of measurable results from our meetings and that I thought it was difficult to try to gain the support of younger members when most of the people in the association were basically retired and had a lot of time to talk and not act. We all talked about how we needed to reform the *Keizaidoyukai* if it was going to be an agent of change in Japan.

I walked away feeling like I should give Mr. Kitashiro a chance to change the *Keizaidoyukai*, but with a feeling that it would be difficult. I can barely stand the tedious task of trying to convince the senior Japanese business executives. I can't image the really young leaders wanting to spend their time in these meetings. It's really a pity considering the strong philosophical foundations upon which the association was founded, but as with anything, age and power bring a variety of issues and it is losing its edge…

*PS I resigned from the New Business Conference per my promise that I made [here](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/10/24/nbc_press_conference.html).*
