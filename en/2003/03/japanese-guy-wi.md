[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/1113b-thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/1113b.html)[A Japanese guy](http://www005.upp.so-net.ne.jp/shinta-kyo/omoutokoro-diary/mage.html) (site in Japanese but great pictures) with long hair cuts his hair to make a *chonmage*. *Chonmage's* are now only [worn by sumo wrestlers](http://pacrimmarketing.com/news/archive/341.html) and actors in samurai movies. This guy goes out to dinner and even gets his picture taken for his drivers license with his new 'doo. [Chris](http://chris.pirillo.com/), you should try this next.
