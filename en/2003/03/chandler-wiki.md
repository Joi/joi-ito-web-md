[Mitch Kapor blogs about](http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000141.html) documentation coming for the 0.1 release of Chandler by the [Open Source Applications Foundation](http://www.osafoundation.org/index.htm). They are [using a Wiki](http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Main/WikiHome) for the collaborative development environment. Great example of how Wiki's are cool.
