That sucks. I wonder if CNN thought he was getting too much attention. He was the only professional journalist on the inside blogging that I know of. Now we have to hope that Christopher of [Back to Iraq 2.0](http://www.back-to-iraq.com/) gets his stuff in order and actually makes it into Iraq and hope that [Salam](http://dear_raed.blogspot.com/) stays alive and keeps on blogging.
