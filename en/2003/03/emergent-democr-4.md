I just finished [version 1.3 of the emergent democracy paper](http://joi.ito.com/static/emergentdemocracy.html). I think this will be my final revision for now and I will focus on new work. This revision includes edits from Chris Case (Thanks Chris!), softening of my stance on a variety of issues vis a vis direct/representative democracy, the point that these tools can enable bad things as well as good things, addition of quotes from [Dee Hock's email](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/10/an_email_from_dee_hock_about_the_emergent_democracy_paper.html), re-write of the conclusion to make it clear that we are focusing on the tools for now to try to create some examples, and admitting that we needed to address the necessity to cause action and that this paper was focused primarily democratic dialog/debate. Left the ant stuff in although that seems to be an issue. I tried to add a bit after the weblog part so that it sounded more like weblogs being similar to ants rather than human beings being similar to ants.
