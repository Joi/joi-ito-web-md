Went to see The Woz. As [I reported before](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/12/06/met_the_woz.html), he's working on some cool new technology at [Wheels of Zeus](http://www.woz.com/). The Woz has a bunch of Segways and he is getting a license to be a Segway trainer. I got notice from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00007EPJ6/ref%3Dsegway%5Ftn%5Fleft/102-8091194-6016955) that I should call them and prepare to receive [my Segway](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/11/19/just_preordered_my_ginger.html). The Woz said he would give me my training course.

The Japanese government just turned down [my request for a special waiver](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/01/26/segways_for_japan.html#003673) to allow me to ride my Segway around in certain parts of Japan, even though the Prime Minister said that all of the waivers should be approved. Anyway, we're going to try to file again in the next round of applications in June.

Until then, maybe I'll keep my Segway in the Valley and cruise around with The Woz. ;-)
