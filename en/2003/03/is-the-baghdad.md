I'm sure everyone knows about "[Where's Raed?](http://dear_raed.blogspot.com/)" a blog by a guy in Baghdad which I wrote about [here](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/17/rant_about_war_from_salam_in_baghdad.html)  and [here](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/11/blogger_in_baghdad.html). (Thanks again John for the original link.) Paul Boutin does some great investigative blogging about where Salam Pax, the Baghdad Blogger, is. His conclusion?
