So [Interpol has issued a "Red Notice"](http://www.interpol.int/Public/ICPO/PressReleases/PR2003/PR200305.asp) asking countries to extradite former Peruvian President Mr. Fujimori. He is charged with a variety of crimes including running a paramilitary death squad. He is of Japanese origin and had hidden his Japanese citizenship until he fled to Japan. Japan accepted him and now is refusing to extradite him to Peru.

I heard that many politicians and business leaders in Japan are big supporters of Fujimori and they even threw a party for him when he arrived in Tokyo.

So, I don't personally know if the Peruvians are politically motivated and unfair as [Fujimori claims](http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/americas/03/11/peru.fujimori.ap/), but ignoring Interpol and secretly admiring a criminal charged with running a death squad is very uncool in my book.
