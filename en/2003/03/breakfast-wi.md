[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/noah-thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/noah.html)Had breakfast with Noah Glass. He's the guy who made [audblog](http://www.audblog.com/). Audblog allows you to post voice/sound blog postings to Blogger from a cell phone. I told him that I WANT IT FOR MOVABLE TYPE. He's working on it. ;-) It's a great idea. Here is a[192K .wav file](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/noah.wav) of him explaining why he thinks it's cool.

We agreed that a lot of people were knocking it without trying it and that it had huge potential in markets like Japan where the cellphone penetration greatly exceeded PC penetration.

Noah seemed like a great guy, focused, vision. Another great member of the Society of Open Standards Tool Builders...
