Just finished lunch. We were at a table with 10 people. There was one iBook and seven PowerBooks. I think everyone had digital cameras. So... Why do conferences sponsored by Intel and Microsoft about wireless technologies attract bloggers with Macintosh computers? I don't know.

I sat between Cory from [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/) and Matthew Haughey of [MetaFilter](http://www.metafilter.com/). We listened to some presentations about wireless, Cory vigorously took notes and I tooks some pictures and thought about how to turn the lunch into a blog entry...
