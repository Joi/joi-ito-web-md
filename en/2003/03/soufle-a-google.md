![soufle_logo.gif](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/soufle_logo.gif)Albert just sent me [a link](https://secure.soufle.com/g6/googleyeyed/) to their new site which allows registered users to save bookmarks in folders and browse and search each other's sites. It reminds me a bit of [OpenCola](http://www.opencola.com/), but this is server based and is integrated with Google using the Google API. You need to register and it is still very early stage, but worth a look if you like new stuff. I suggested that they needed to work on buddy lists and grouping. They're working on some of this stuff this week.
