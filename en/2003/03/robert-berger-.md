[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/robertberger-thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/robertberger.html)Saw Robert Berger yesterday. He is yet another very cool person I met through John Markoff. (Thanks John!) Robert is a radio guru. [Glocom](http://www.glocom.ac.jp/top/index.e.html) had invited him to Japan to work on a report about spectrum. I'm glad he was invited to Japan and got a chance to learn about Japan and meet the community here. He'll be returning to Silicon Valley soon. He will be one more of the few important people there who have experience in Japan. I continue to feel that the bridge between Silicon Valley and Japan is still too weak and the more cool people who can spend a little time in Japan and return to the US to be, if not advocates, at least conscious of Japan, the better. Looking forward to hearing what Robert plans to do next!
