Sébastien Paquet quotes  [Tom Munnecke's comments on](http://www.munnecke.com/blog/archives/2003_03.html#000099) [Dee Hock's letter](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/10/an_email_from_dee_hock_about_the_emergent_democracy_paper.html), Dee Hock's [article leader-followers](http://futurepositive.synearth.net/2003/01/03) and [the World of Ends](http://www.worldofends.com/) and has an "ah ha" moment about why David and Doc's vision is difficult to implement.

> Reading this helped me pin down precisely what makes me uneasy about David and Doc's World of Ends piece. They're trying to do exactly that, make current executives and the ilk streamline themselves, instead of targeting, giving hope to, and helping organize those who have little to lose. I suspect that the attitude shift that David and Doc are hoping for is only going to materialize once this groundwork alternative organization effort is well underway and pretty much everybody has woken up and smelled the coffee.

Yes... my precious... This is what I was trying to talk about in [my entry about the lust for power](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/02/24/can_we_control_our_lust_for_power.html). It is really difficult to ask the people who have power to give it up. Even if they are your friends. Telling them may even tip them off to your strategy and allow them to more easily resist it. How do you organize a more grassroots, "lets just get on with it" attitude? It is important to have a message and a framework that is easy to understand, but we have to make sure that we target the people and empower the people instead of targeting power and trying unpower them. (Not trying to say here that World of Ends is wrong. It is just that some people are asking, "who are you talking to?")
