> even more stupid dsico mashups, remixes and pop destruction: even better than the real thing

I recently discovered this new form (Feel free to tell me that this is old news and I'm totally out of it. I have no idea...) of remix on [Takemura-sensei's blog](http://blog.neoteny.com/takemura/). These are remixes which mash together weird combinations of artists making a totally strange, but really cool new version. There are two site [dsico](http://4trak.net/dsico/download.html) and [ritmic](http://www.ritmic.com/hitmania/especiales/bootleg/losmejores.html) which have a bunch of these remixes that you can download. Have no idea who "owns" this stuff, but totally weird and cool and great for testing my new E5c's. ;-)

Here are some examples:

[Celine Dion+Sigur Ros](http://www.ritmic.com/hitmania/especiales/bootleg/bot12.html)  
[Whitney Houston+Kraftwerk](http://www.ritmic.com/hitmania/especiales/bootleg/bot07.html)  
[Eminem+Britney Spears](http://www.ritmic.com/hitmania/especiales/bootleg/bot02.html)  
[Kylie Minogue+New Order](http://www.ritmic.com/hitmania/especiales/bootleg/bot09.html#)
