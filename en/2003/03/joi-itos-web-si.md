| Chart of weekly server requests since I started using Movable Type on June 25, 2002. I wish I could plot traffic vs. hours blogging. It would probably be a flat line... |

I have never published my site stats before, but my March 1 analog (Analog is no longer. [Here are some other tools](https://www.comparitech.com/net-admin/log-management-tools/).) run just finished, I'm sitting in a hotel room with nothing to blog and nothing to do, so might as well...

These stats exclude accesses from any of my own networks. ;-)
