I'm a bit late in commenting on this, but Adam released it in the middle of my Silicon Valley [immersive experience](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/04/making_room_for_more_new_friends.html) and had a hard time concentrating. His paper which is available as a [pdf file](http://v-2.org/minimalcompactpublicbeta1.pdf) or [on his web page](http://v-2.org/displayArticle.php?article_cat=4) is an interesting idea. The basic idea is to create a constitution and manage it like we manage open source software projects. It's a short paper and he doesn't elaborate on some of the details of how it would be done, but I think it is an interesting notion.

I've worked with some UN model law around electronic commerce and [cyber arbitration](http://joi.ito.com/archives/1999/02/04/technology_security_and_cyber_arbitration.html), and some of the ideas are similar. Create a core code base that people can adapt and use locally. Helps harmonize. The main difference between what the UN does and what Adam is suggesting is the use of an open structure like open source.

I think the paper is a bit too geeky for lawyers and a bit to constitutional law oriented for geeks. I have the same problem with my [emergent democracy paper](http://joi.ito.com/static/emergentdemocracy.html).

Adam is releasing 1.0 this summer, I think. Look forward to reading it.

> I'm gonna get my deep geek on here, and go public with something I've been putting a great deal of thought and effort into lately: apropos of many recent discussions of "emergent democracy," here's a proposal - a "minifesto," if you will - for the constitution of virtual, post-national states. The relationship to conceptions of democracy should be obvious.

> Go 'head and shoot holes in it: I'm not a constitutional lawyer, nor do I play one on TV. The ideas proposed herein may well not stand up to extended inspection, which is OK with me. Think of this, then, as a public beta, offered as a conversation starter only.
