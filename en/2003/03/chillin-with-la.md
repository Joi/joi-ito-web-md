[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/larrypage-thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/larrypage.html)Went over to Google to hang out with Larry Page. Larry is one of the smartest people I've met and I wanted to get his opinion on some theories I had about where personal communication devices were going. We had started the discussion in Davos and were following up. Larry is a World Economic Forum "Global Leader for Tomorrow" and was also at Paul Saffo's Annual Geeks Dinner in Davos. I had met Larry a few times in the past, but it wasn't until we started talking about technology that we started to communicate in earnest. Sergey dropped in for awhile and we hung out in an office that looked more like a living room with lots of gadgets and toys. Definitely a great environment to work.
