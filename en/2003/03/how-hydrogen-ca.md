Great article in Wired about the Hydrogen Economy by Peter Schwartz and Doug Randall.

> The cost of oil dependence has never been so clear. What had long been largely an environmental issue has suddenly become a deadly serious strategic concern. Oil is an indulgence we can no longer afford, not just because it will run out or turn the planet into a sauna, but because it inexorably leads to global conflict. Enough. What we need is a massive, Apollo-scale effort to unlock the potential of hydrogen, a virtually unlimited source of power. The technology is at a tipping point. Terrorism provides political urgency. Consumers are ready for an alternative. From Detroit to Dallas, even the oil establishment is primed for change. We put a man on the moon in a decade; we can achieve energy independence just as fast. Here's how.

[I wrote about the hydrogen economy before](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/11/23/the_hydrogen_economy.html). I first learned to use computers at, was on the board of and am currently an advisor to management of one of the pioneering companies in the hydrogen economy, [Energy Conversion Devices](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/10/18/ecd_informationenergy.html). The founder Stan Ovshinsky has been talking about the hydrogen economy since 1955 and the company, when founded in 1960, was founded in large part to solve many of the issues discussed in the article. It's amazing to see a "[buzz](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/10/kim_says_the_buzz_is_back.html)" that takes almost 50 years to come around. I'm glad that at 80 years old, Stan can see a lot of his his vision unfold.
