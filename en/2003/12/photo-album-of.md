I'd like to put together a photo album on TypePad of last night's Creative Commons party. If you have any photos you wouldn't mind sharing under a [CC by-nc-sa](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/) license, please send them to me. I will play editor and select photos and add my own captions, but if you have captions, especially names of people in photos, that would be helpful. If you've posted the pictures yourself, please either post links here or trackback.

Thanks for all of those who showed up. It was a great party!
