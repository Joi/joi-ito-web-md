[Halley](http://halleyscomment.blogspot.com/), thanks for having [#joiito over to your party](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/12/31/can_joiito_come_to_your_dean_new_year_house_party_halley.html). Thanks also for [sharing your interaction with your wine bottles after the party](http://halleyscomment.blogspot.com/2003_12_28_halleyscomment_archive.html#107284421287245699). I'll be doing a lot of the same over the next few days. Ever since I noticed that [I am now the top result for a google search on "quit drinking"](http://www.google.com/search?q=quit+drinking) I have this sense of responsibility to myself as well as others to show my/our resolve and share this.

I was talking on the phone today with someone trained as a professional in treating addiction. It's interesting to note that when AA was started in the 60's 30's, it was difficult to find other people who would be supportive during the process of trying to quit drinking. There was also quite a bit of social stigma associated with recognizing an addiction and trying to deal with it. It is much more common today and with chat, email and blogs, it's easier to find people to talk to about this.

Nothing against AA and I am fascinated by it, but I think that this cross-blog support network we are creating for people who have chosen to quit drinking is really amazing and it will be interesting to see where this leads. If anyone else wants to join [Halley](http://www.halleyscomment.blogspot.com/2003_12_14_halleyscomment_archive.html#107149967340094751), [dav](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/12/15/quit_drinking.html#n012784) and [me](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/12/15/quit_drinking.html), this is a good a chance as any. ;-)
