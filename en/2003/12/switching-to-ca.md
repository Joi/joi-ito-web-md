Ever since I saw a $30K digital back for my Hasselblad, I've been waiting for digital photography to come to REAL cameras. The guy at the store said, "some day they will be cheap enough to be worth it." Then I saw [the article about the Digital-Modul-R digital back for the Leica R8/R9](http://www.leica-camera.com/produkte/rsystem/digitalmodul/index_e.html), I decided that I was going to go that route. I have a whole R8 system with many many lenses and this just made sense to me. Yesterday I went to a camera shop and asked when they would have them. "Oh, probably about a year from now." !!! I broke down and bought the [Canon EOS "Kiss" Digital or a 300D](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos300d/) as they call them in the US. I'm very happy with it. It's reasonably priced and just works. I was getting really frustrated with crappy digital cameras and using the 300D just feels right.

I'll still use my [Hasselblad](http://www.hasselblad.com/chooseRegion.asp) and my [Nikon Coolscan 8000 film scanner](http://www.nikon-image.com/eng/news_release/2001/ls-8000.html) for medium format work, but I think I'm going to dump 35mm photography and switch to digital for awhile and see how it goes.

Yesterday, I played with my camera and posted [more pictures of the house](http://joi.typepad.com/photos/inbamura/) and of [Bo](http://joi.typepad.com/photos/bo/). Still messing around...
