Warren Ellis, author of [Transmetropoitan](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1563894459/) and "[die puny humans](http://www.diepunyhumans.com/)", asked some of us to do something for his blog on thinking about the coming year. I took the opportunity to [expose the "die puny humans" facet of my identity](http://www.diepunyhumans.com/archives/006856.html). It's a slightly different persona than the one I use here so it was fun to write. Warren's got quite an interesting roundup of people.
