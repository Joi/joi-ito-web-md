The Gary Wolf article, "[How the Internet Invented Howard Dean](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.01/dean_pr.html)" in Wired Magazine that I  [blogged about earlier](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/10/27/gary_wolf_on_the_internet_side_of_the_dean_campaign_for_wired.html) just came online. As [David Weinberger says](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002294.html), it's a covers the theoretical side of the campaign and is a good addition to [Ed Cone's article on the operations](http://www.baselinemag.com/article2/0,3959,1386982,00.asp) and the [NY Times Magazine](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30B12FF3A5E0C748CDDAB0994DB404482) article about the spirit of the campaign.
