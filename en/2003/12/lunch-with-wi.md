I had lunch with Willem Dakota Neuefeind Lessig and his parents [Larry](http://www.lessig.org/blog/) and Bettina. Willem is still three months old but gets around quite a bit. He was visiting Tokyo this week and invited me to lunch with his parents. Apparently Willem and Larry have a game they play where they take turns mimicking and repeating what the other says. One time Larry cheated and repeated the phrase twice instead of one time according to the rules. Willem was very upset by this and questions Larry's understanding of the rule of law.
