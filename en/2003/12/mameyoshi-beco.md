Mizuka and I went to Kyoto yesterday to celebrate Mameyoshi becoming a *geisha*. Mameyoshi was a *maiko* until recently. *Maiko* are young girls who live in *okiya* and are in training to become *geisha* They generally start when they are 15-16 and can be identified by their long flowing *obi* and the fact that they use their real hair for the hair styling. Typically *maiko* become *geisha* and become independent when they are 18-20 years old. There are two types of *geisha*. *Geisha* who perform with musical elements and *geisha* who are focused on dancing. Usually, *geisha* who perform with musical instruments are not *maiko* first, but Mameyoshi took the irregular path of going from *maiko* to *geisha*. They do a ritual called *erikaishi* where they change their *kimomo* style and switch from their real hair to wigs. Mameyoshi became a *shamisen* player and performed for us yesterday. The two *maiko* dancing are Teruyuki and Terukoma. The first dance is *kagamimochi* and the second one is *gion kouta* (one of my favorites). Apologies for the noise in the background. There was a fire engine outside.

[I've uploaded a 55M QT movie of the performance.](http://joi.ito.com/movies/mameyoshidance.mov) Here is a [torrent](http://joi.ito.com/archives/torrents/mameyoshidance.torrent)  of the file.
