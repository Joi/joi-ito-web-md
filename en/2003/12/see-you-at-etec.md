I'll be at the [O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/) February 9-12 in San Diego. It looks like I'll be doing a session with Ethan Zuckerman on the [Emergent Democracy Forum day](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/et2004/edemo.csp) February 9th and [a session](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2004/view/e_sess/4865) with [danah](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/), [Mimi](http://www.itofisher.com/mito/index.html), [Howard](http://www.rheingold.com/howard/), [Scott](http://www.itofisher.com/sfisher/index.html) and others on the 10th about mobility, identity and culture. Hope to see you there.

*The panel members are not "final-final" so they are not on the web yet. I'll post the description of the sessions and the final-final members here when we get everything confirmed.*
