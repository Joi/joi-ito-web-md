[Justin's post from his Christmas in Japan last year](http://www.links.net/vita/trip/japan/spirit/christmas/) describes the Japanese Christmas experience well. Here is my [entry about brining](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/12/21/the_turkey.html), which is the key to the turkey he talks about. As I was [opining to MG](http://joi.typepad.com/photos/cc_anniversary_03/cimg0164jpg.html) the other day, it's all in the bringing. MUST brine the turkey.
