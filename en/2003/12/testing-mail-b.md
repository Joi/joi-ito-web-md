Larry is using a white-list spam filter called [Mail Blocks](http://www.mailblocks.com). I used to run a server side white-list spam blocker but people got upset so I stopped. Now people are upset because of false positives and just getting buried in my email. I think I'll try this for awhile. Bear with me. You will probably get a challenge/response the first time you send me email again.
