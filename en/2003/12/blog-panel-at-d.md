Loic and I will be on the blog panel at [Davos](http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/Annual+Meeting+2004) this year. [Loic blogs about it and asserts that "Blogging will have the same effect to journalism as Napster & P2P to the music industry".](http://www.u-blog.com/loic/note/57128.) Interesting. Doc follows up with [a rant about how Napster was just "market correction for the failure of mainstream radio".](http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/12/06#theNewTradition)
