The other day, in [#joiito](http://joi.ito.com/IrcChannel), a pretty hardcore [troll](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TrollDefinition) dropped into the channel. The funny thing was, everyone was like, "weeee a real live troll, lets play with the troll!" The troll was sufficiently outnumbered by our band of merry IRCers and I think the troll figured out that at then end, the joke was on him/her. It's nice when you have a community that can deal with trolls at a meta level and even have fun with it.
