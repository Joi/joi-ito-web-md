[Seyed Razavi](http://www.monkeyx.com/) has announced that he has shut down [Blogshares](http://www.blogshares.com/). As [Jeff Jarvis says](http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2003_12.html#005326), "It was fun while it lasted."

Look forward to seeing what Seyed is cooking up next that's kept him too busy to run Blogshares...

*Thanks for the [heads up](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/12/03/speaking_of_turtles.html#n012343) [Jason](http://apophenia.us/)*
