[Rael Dornfest](http://www.raelity.org/) just launched [MobileWhack](http://www.mobilewhack.com/).
> MobileWhack is all about that mobile handset, palmtop, hiptop, ipod, or laptop in your pocket, purse, briefcase, or dangling from your utility belt. It's about squeezing every last ounce of mobility out of your mobile device.

Looks cool!
