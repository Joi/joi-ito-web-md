[Jonas has a good blog entry](http://blog.netwarriors.org/d/2003/12/24/cure_addiction) in response to [Marc's comment about the 12 steps](http://blogs.it/0100198/2003/12/24.html#a2099). Interesting and thoughtful deconstruction of obsessive-compulsive disorders and curing and managing addiction. The only place where I would disagree is that I actually do exhibit a variety of symptoms of addiction and that's why I've chosen to stop drinking.

Update: [Jonas comments on the 12 steps](http://blog.netwarriors.org/d/2003/12/25/what_are_the_12_steps). I have never been to an AA meeting, although I've ordered the book and intend to try going, but the comments from Jonas are... sobering. Any thoughts from people who swear by the 12 steps?
