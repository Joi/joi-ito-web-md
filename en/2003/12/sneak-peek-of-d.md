I've blogged about Joe before, but he's an old buddy of mine from "back in the day." He made Starship Warlock, one of the coolest CD ROM games during that period. Recently, Joe's been doing Flash animations/stories with music. The last series he did, [Radiskull and Devil Doll](http://joesparks.com/radiskull/) rocked. It really defined a new style.
Now he's got a preview of his new series, [Dicky & Jackie](http://www.joesparks.com/dj/introtheme/) online.
*Thanks for coming to the CC party Joe. Now you've got to release some stuff under CC. ;-)*
