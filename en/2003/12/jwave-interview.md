I'm going to be on the Japanese FM radio station J-Wave tonight talking about blogging. I just got a technorati inbound instant message from my technorati script telling me that I just received a link from Sachiko who will be interviewing me tonight. [She blogged about meeting me today](http://kesavinchiintokyo.blogspot.com/2003_12_01_kesavinchiintokyo_archive.html#107089679085883588). She blogs! How cool is that. Look forward to meeting you!

It's from 21:15 on J-Wave if anyone is interested, but if you're reading this, you probably don't need to listen. ;-)
