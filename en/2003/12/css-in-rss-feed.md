[Richard](http://www.crystalflame.net/) showed me how to put my style sheet (Which [Boris](http://bopuc.levendis.com/RowBoat/) made) in my feeds ([RSS 1.0](http://joi.ito.com/index.rdf)/[RSS 2.0](http://joi.ito.com/index.xml)). Take a look at it in your news reader and tell me what you think. Also, if you think this is "funky" please let me know why. It is sort of a weird thing, but at least in [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/), it looks pretty good.

[Richard describes how to do it on his blog.](http://www.crystalflame.net/2003/12/rss_with_css.html)
