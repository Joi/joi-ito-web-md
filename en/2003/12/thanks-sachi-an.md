The [J-Wave interview](http://www.j-wave.co.jp/original/jamtheworld/) was a blast. We must have said "blog" 50 times in 30 minutes. It was especially fun because everyone there were recent blog addicts. We tried very hard to explain it to people who had never blogged before, but I think a few times we probably got a bit hardcore. Anyway, I think if nothing else, we were able to convey our excitement and people will at least try to learn more about blogs. J-Wave is the 3rd largest radio station in Japan and has a lot of reach so I hope we have some impact. We got a lot of email from people during the show.

Anyway, thanks [Sachi](http://kesavinchiintokyo.blogspot.com/) and [Nonaka-san](http://www.viewz.jp/)!

[Here's the 32 meg mp3 of the show](http://joi.ito.com/images2/joijwave.mp3). (It's in Japanese.)
