I've been getting more and more email with links to flash animations. I'm going to have to try making my own flash animations again. What's interesting is to think about flash in the context of creative commons and how people are sharing their tricks and their code. Here are a few new ones and a list of some of my other favorites.  

**Some new ones**- ["Europe and Italy"](http://www.infonegocio.com/xeron/bruno/italy.html) - via Markoff
- [Bush Sucks](http://www.eviltron.com/bushsucks/) via [Lisa](http://www.onlisareinsradar.com/archives/002041.php)

**Some old ones**- [Joi's first flash](http://joi.ito.com/static/device.html)
- [liberation of Afghanistan](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2003/03/26/fioreliberation.DTL) - via Tom Hammer
- [Irrational Exuberance](http://www.verylowsodium.com/fanimutation/exuberance.php)
- [ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US](http://www.scene.org/redhound/AYB.swf)
- [Admiral Perry's real voice](http://www1.odn.ne.jp/satoumizu/#)
- [badger](http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/badgers.php)

UPDATE: [gansta gollum](http://nedevett.com/gollum.swf) via [Accordian Guy](http://accordionguy.blogware.com/blog) via [Betsy](http://betsydevine.weblogger.com/) - *awesome*

Oh! And don't forget the [Creative Commons flash animation contest](http://creativecommons.org/contest/). Deadline is Dec 31. First prize is a dual CPU Apple G5.
