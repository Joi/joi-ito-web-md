[Anil](http://www.dashes.com/anil/) introduced me to rebecca blood of [rebecca's pocket](http://www.rebeccablood.net/) last night at the CC party. I remember reading rebecca's [ten tips for a better weblog](http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/ten_tips.html) when I was starting my blog. They were my guiding principles. If you're starting a blog and are trying to figure out how and what you should write about, I'd start there.

> Know your intended audience. You conduct yourself differently with your friends than you do with professional associates, strangers, customers, or your grandmother. Knowing for whom you are writing will allow you to adopt an appropriate tone.

This is the difficult question that many of us deal with because sometimes we end up with unintended audiences or our contexts collapse. [danah](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/) and I have been discussing this issue a lot in the context of Goffman and managing the facets of your identity.
rebecca's ten tips are a good place to start because you'll never be able to manage developing a facet of your identity unless you have enough passion about what you are writing to do it frequently and rigorously enough to make your blog interesting. If you focus on your passion, it's likely you will attract the audience you are looking for. Having said that, sometimes contexts do collapse and you get unintended audiences. This can tend to cause a chilling effect and make it difficult to write freely. If your blog becomes popular, this is inevitable. Having said that, it often adds more rigor and forces you to research more thoroughly before posting, which is a good thing.
