![](http://joi.ito.com/images2/deangame.jpg)The [Dean for Iowa Game](http://www.deanforamericagame.com/) just went online. It's cute and fun and captures the spirit of being a supporter. I'm glad to have played my own little part in making this happen. The game was developed by Ian Bogost and his team at [Persuasive Games](http://www.persuasivegames.com/). Ian contacted me through [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/). LinkedIn routed his request for contact via a mutual friend, Ian McCarthy who vouched for Ian Bogost. I took that request and forwarded it to [Britt Blaser](http://www.blaserco.com/blogs/) who is working with the Dean campaign. Britt is "Mr. Execution" and before I knew it, The Dean for Iowa Game happened. Congratulations to all involved!
