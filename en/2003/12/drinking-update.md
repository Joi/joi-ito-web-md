So far so good...

I haven't had a drink since I quit drinking. It may just be the novelty, but I'm enjoying myself greatly. I slept 10 hours last night (the most I can remember sleeping in years), I feel great and interestingly I don't feel and physiological withdrawals. I have the momentary, "boy, I need a drink" at the beginning of dinner, but once I get over that, I seem to be fine. Maybe it's that I'm surrounded by interesting people. Also, I realize that I can now work productively after dinner and my conversations during dinner are lucid and more intelligent. Anyway, I know that the "when you least expect it, expect it" rule applies here, but I think I'm off to a good start thanks to all of your support. Thanks everyone.

*PS If anyone catches me staring longly at a bottle of wine, feel free to smack me.*
