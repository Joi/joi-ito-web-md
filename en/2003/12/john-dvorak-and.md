| John C. Dvorak and his new book |

Rounded up some of the the local capital "J" journalists last night and had an interesting dinner. Mostly we just played with gadgets talked politics, but it's always fun to hear journalists talk shop.

"Oh, what are you working on these days." "I'm working on a few scoops." "Oh! Like what?" ;-)

Reminds me of sitting next to [Dave Weinberger](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/) at a conference where we kept looking over each other's shoulders when we were blogging.

[John Dvorak](http://www.dvorak.org/) dropped in briefly to [plug his new book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0131423630/).
