I just [posted some pictures](http://joi.typepad.com/photos/cc_anniversary_03) from the [Creative Commons Anniversary Party](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/12/13/creative_commons_anniversary_party.html). Thanks to [Jonas](http://blog.netwarriors.org/) and [Cory](http://www.boingboing.net/) for contributing their photos.

*It was also my first party since my [sobriety](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/12/15/quit_drinking.html) and I enjoyed myself very much.*

PS: If anyone has any other pictures that would be willing to contribute to this photo album, please email me or post a link here. Thanks!
