[Delicious](http://del.icio.us/) is a social bookmarks manager. It is still pre-pre-alpha, but it's already become quite a useful part of my daily routine. You bookmark sites as you surf and you can subscribe to bookmarks of your friends and receive them as RSS feeds. It all started during a rare productive discussion between tangra and \_joshua on [#joiito](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel). The two of them came up with the idea and \_joshua coded it.

\_joshua is aka [Joshua Schachter](http://burri.to/~joshua/) and is also the developer of [memepool](http://memepool.com/) and [GeoURL](http://geourl.org/).

If you want to subscribe to my bookmarks, I'm [joi\_ito](http://del.icio.us/joi_ito) on [Delicious](http://del.icio.us/).
