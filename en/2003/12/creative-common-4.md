They showed a great flash animation explaining [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org) and giving an update. [It's a 7 meg flash file.](http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/recticulum_rex/cc.milestones.121503.swf) They will post a smaller version of it on the CC site later. Just wanted to post this for people who missed yesterday's party.

There is a credit roll at the end of the animation. Thanks to everyone who worked on this.
