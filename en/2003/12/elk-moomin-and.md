Amazing Finnish day yesterday. Started the morning meeting Marko's mom and dad. Then we went to [Hvitträsk](http://www.nba.fi/museums/hvittr/englanti.htm).

> Hvitträsk was built 1901–1903, by three architects, Herman Gesellius, Armas Lindgren and Eliel Saarinen. The main building, designed in National Romantic style, built of logs and natural stone, was both a common studio and a home for Eliel Saarinen and Armas Lindgren. Gesellius lived in the courtyard building. The Saarinen home is a museum today, and the courtyard building has a restaurant and a café. Hvitträsk and the garden in English style are surrounded by beautiful nature.

Herman Gesellius, Armas Lindgren and Eliel Saarinen were basically three young and really smart architects from Helsinki Polytechnic, graduating just 8 years or so after the first architecture program there. They lead the field of architecture in Finland and paved the way for generations to come. It seems like they were an edgy, hyper-motivated team trying to change the world through their lifestyle. It reminds me of [etoy](http://www.etoy.com). Everything from the furniture to the clothing was design by the team. One funny thing was the "Whiskey Rings" in the main living/party room. If you had too much whiskey where you couldn't stand on one leg while holding on to a whiskey ring, you had to go to bed.

In the evening we went to Keitto Kokka, a famous restaurant in Helsinki. We had a "Game Food Course". We cooked our own wild game meal while being tutored on wild game, cooking and wine. I worked on the Elk. We also had hare and pigeon. It was absolutely amazing and fun. The passion of the chef and the sommelier was also completely contagious. Unfortunately, as the evening went on, my jet lag kicked in an I almost passed out at the end. Apologies to the other guests. ;-)

During dinner, Lisa took me out on a short break to see some sites near the restaurant. I got to see the impressive ice breakers, sitting in the harbor waiting to be called out to break lanes in the ice as the ice starts to form in the sea.

We also passed the childhood home of Tove Jansson. She is the author of the [Moomin](http://john.stienen.nl/) series which was my main memory of Finland growing up as a child. I loved to watch Moomin on TV in Japan. Lisa told me that Tove was [said to be a lesbian](http://gayinfo.tripod.com/A-Z-J.html) and that she was not allowed to read Moomin growing up as a child. Tove supposedly lived on a loft hanging over the main room that her father had built and wrote about the wild parties that her parents threw that would leave her loft swinging. I didn't know anything about the author of the Moomin series so this connection to a childhood memory was very interesting.

Thanks Marko et al!
