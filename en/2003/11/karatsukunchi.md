We went to the Karatsukunchi festival near Fukuoka. We had an great meal including the incredibly rare *kue* fish. I uploaded [some pictures of our meal](http://joi.typepad.com/photos/karatsukunchi03/). There were 14 floats that went past our restaurant. I've uploaded a [2MB mov file](http://joi.ito.com/images2/katsurakunchi.mov).
