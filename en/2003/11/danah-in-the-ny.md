I've recently been communicating with [danah](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/) quite a bit about her identity related work. She's got a very unique research style which I identify with. I like to immerse myself in what I'm trying to learn and use myself as the test subject. It must be harder to do this as an academic, but danah seems to be able to do it. She immerses herself, but leave enough room to be objective. Good [article about her and her work in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/27/technology/circuits/27frie.html?ex=1385269200&en=50a5d84e0734eec4&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND).
