The lack of activity in the US in protesting the [treatment of foreign national at the borders](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/10/14/homeland_security_at_the_border.html), the [extradition of foreign nationals to countries known to torture](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/11/06/maher_arar_a_canadian_arrested_and_deported_by_the_us_government_to_be_tortured_in_syria.html) and disinterest in the the profiling and secret arrests of Americans of Middle Eastern descent is disconcerting.

Remember, some day they may come looking for you.
