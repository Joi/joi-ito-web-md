Tomorrow is the general election for the Japanese parliament's Lower House. Mizuka and I joined the Governor of Nagano, [Yasuo Tanaka](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/09/02/tanaka_reelected_nagano_gov.html), [Shigeaki Saegusa](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/07/10/shigeaki_saegusas_kanreki.html) (the conductor), Jun Maki (the copywriter who appears in Lost in Translation as the producer of the photo shoot), [Yoichiro Kawaguchi](http://www.race.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yoichiro/) (computer graphics professor), [Hajime Takano](http://www.smn.co.jp/takano/) (journalist) and many others in a two hour march through Ginza urging people go and vote tomorrow. It was called the [*senkyo ni ikouzei!*](http://www.telespot.co.jp/senkyo/) movement. Our march was a nonpartisan effort to get people to vote regardless of their politics. We handed out leaflets, waved flags and made speeches on street corners. I made a speech about how most Japanese believe something needs to change yet do not feel they have any impact. I argued that Yasuo Tanaka showed that politicians can cause change and that voters can elect such officials. I stressed that you get the politicians you deserve and that if we wanted a democracy in Japan, people were going to have to vote.

It was a hot day, but people were very receptive. It was clear they were happy to see Yasuo Tanaka and unlike [the time we were handing out leaflets protesting the National ID](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/08/04/rally_against_the_national_id.html), the percentage of people willing to take them from you was much higher.

Also, the opposition party of Japan, the Democratic Party of Japan [has announced](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/geted.pl5?ed20031107a1.htm ) a "shadow cabinet" appointing Yasuo Tanaka the minister in charge of decentralization. Ishihara, the mayor of Tokyo has spoken out against this.
