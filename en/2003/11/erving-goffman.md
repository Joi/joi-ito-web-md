[Mimi](http://www.itofisher.com/mito/) and [danah](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/) both refer to Erving Goffman's book, "The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life" so I've started reading it with digital identities and blogging in mind.
> Goffman

> It should be understood that the cynic, with all of his professional disinvolvement, may obtain unprofessional pleasures from his masquerade, experiencing a kind of gleeful spiritual aggression from the fact that he can toy at will with something his audience must take seriously.

This TOTALLY reminded me of Dvorak. He always as a gleeful look when he talks about his performances.
> Goffman

> It is not assumed, of course, that all cynical performers are interested in deluding their audiences for purposes of what is called "self-interest" or private gain. A cynical individual may delude his audience for what he considers to be their own good, or for the good of the community, etc.

Dvorak again. By the way, I love Dvorak and think he's hilarious, but it's watching the performance that I love.
