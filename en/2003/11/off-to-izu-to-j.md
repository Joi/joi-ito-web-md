I'm off to attend the 22nd annual Izu Conference. It's a conference sponsored by IBM with a great deal of history. It's about an equal number of business people, bureaucrats, politicians and academics and has a fairly balanced male/female ratio. It's usually around 50 people. It's basically the same members each year with a few new members added each year. The membership represents people who seemed to be chosen for being clued in, not for being just famous our powerful. I already confirmed that I can blog about stuff we talk about there. This year's topic is what we think of the US. ;-)
