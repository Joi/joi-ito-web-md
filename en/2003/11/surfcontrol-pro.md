Dan Gillmor writes about how [censorware blocks his site.](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001509.shtml#001509) It's blocking mine too.

> [Simon Phipps alerts me](http://www.webmink.net/2003_11_09_oldblog.htm#106885559747905573) that one of the big censorware outfits, [SurfControl](http://www.surfcontrol.com), is blocking this and other blogs as a default setting for some customers. He points to Jon Udell's report of [a surrealistic conversation](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/06/13.html#a721) with a company salesdroid upon his own such discovery. Good grief.

SurfControl puts all blogs under Usenet, a fairly bizarre characterization of the genre, but par for the course for the censorware mavens. They tend to sweep big categories into their filter, and then let you try to find your own way to escape.
