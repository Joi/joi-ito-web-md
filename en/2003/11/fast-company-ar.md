[Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) did an [article for Fast Company](http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/76/sgodin.html) about how I use my blog and IRC and am adapting my work-style to the social software. His perspective is interesting. I hadn't thought of it as a "virtual organization". I'm also glad he got this part right:

*Thanks Seth!*
