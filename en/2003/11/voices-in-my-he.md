[![](http://joi.ito.com/images/loicchat-tm.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/images/loicchat.gif)I'm chatting with [Loic](http://www.u-blog.net/loic) right now. Loic has a very distinct French accent. I hear his voice in my head. I've always had a problem reading and I think it's because I tend to hear text rather than read it directly. The interesting thing is that when I know the voice of the author, I hear the author's voice. The voice can cause a very emotional reaction. The other day, when I was reading an email, I got so excited I even noticed a taste. It was a kind of email induced [synesthesia](http://web.mit.edu/synesthesia/www/synesthesia.html).

With iChat, maybe because of the real-time nature and the icon/face, the voice seems much more clear.

Am I crazy?
