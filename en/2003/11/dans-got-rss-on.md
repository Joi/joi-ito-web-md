OK I've got gadget envy. [Dan blogs](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001543.shtml#001543) about his RSS feed on his Treo 600 and says he wants a client that lets him blog easily from it too. Anyone know of anything good? Ado, want to port [Kung-Log](http://www.kung-foo.tv/kunglog.php) to PalmOS?
