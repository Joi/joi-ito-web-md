Oh cool! [Dvorak is bashing blogs again.](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,1382914,00.asp) It must be that time of year again. He probably needs more traffic.

Oops. I broke [my promise not to make fun of journalists who don't blog](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/10/29/lets_stop_picking_on_journalists_who_dont_blog.html)... But I'll make an exception for [journalists who like to tease me too.](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/05/16/dinner_with_markoff_and_dvorak.html)

UPDATE: Steve Gillmor takes the bait and [responds to Dvorak](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,1393379,00.asp).
