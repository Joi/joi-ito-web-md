[Xeni chats with my sister Mimi](http://boingboing.net/2003_11_01_archive.html#106986668526334438) [on NPR](http://www.npr.org/rundowns/rundown.php?prgDate=26-Nov-2003&prgId=17) and [Mimi](http://itofisher.com/mito/) talks about her [*bento* moblog](http://mito.typepad.com/photos/bento/). The *bento* moblog reminds me of when my mother used to make [*bento*](http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entries/67/o0006700.html) for me when I was growing up in Birmingham, Michigan. I was HORRIFIED when she would pack [*onigiri*](http://www.greggman.com/japan/onigiri/onigiri.htm) for me because everyone would make fun of my rice ball or call it a bomb. Yikes.
