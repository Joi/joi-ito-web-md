I'm in San Francisco from November 11 for 48 hours. I'm free for dinner on the 11th. Sign up on the [wiki page](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/DinnerSanFranNov11) if you're interested in getting together. I'm arriving on that day so I may be a bit tired, but I'd be happy to meet up with everyone.

Jacob Levy has agreed to help organize it. Thanks Jacob.
