Speaking of false positives, I'm also against blacklists because they can also cause false positives that are difficult to correct. [Smartmobs](http://www.smartmobs.com/index.html) was blacklisted by Verio and it took [Roland two months of hell](http://radio.weblogs.com/0105910/categories/sidebars/2003/11/09.html) to get it sorted out.

*I know I use a blacklist for my comment filtering. It's a stop-gap measure until someone figures out a better solution.*
