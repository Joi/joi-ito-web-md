[Interview in eWeek with John Patrick](http://www.eweek.com/print_article/0,3048,a=113189,00.asp) on blogging. [John Patrick](http://www.patrickweb.com/), the former vice president of Internet technology at IBM, is an old friend and an [advisory board member of Neoteny](http://blog.neoteny.com/neoteny/advisory.html). He helped IBM embrace the Internet. He's a great voice in this discussion because he's very familiar with corporate CIO behavior.
