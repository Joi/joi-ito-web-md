I recently talked to someone who talked to a journalist off the record and was quoted anyway. This happens to me too. I think it might be interesting if we could figure out a way to share our experiences with specific journalists. I got the idea from reading [Dan Gillmor's book](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000924.shtml) about how the defense department posts full transcripts of interviews on its web site so people can read the context in which statements are made. Maybe we can link to or upload such transcripts as well. Hopefully, this will help make journalists a bit more honest and give the honest ones a bit more credit. I'm going to try to start it on a [wiki page](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/JournalistReputation), but we may have to move it to something more structured depending on how it goes. Obviously, positive feedback about journalists is also something that we should track.
