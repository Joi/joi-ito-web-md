Junjiro Hara is a well known reporter at the Asahi Shimbun who I've known for many years. He is retiring this year and has [decided to start blogging](http://blog.neoteny.com/junhara/) and continue his mission as a journalist to change Japan. His blog is in Japanese. I think he is one of the first professional mass media journalists to start officially blogging.
