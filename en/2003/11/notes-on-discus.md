I just [posted my rather rough notes](http://www.chanpon.org/archives/2003/11/18/notes_from_izu_conference_discussion_about_the_us.html) about from the discussion at the Izu Conference about the US and Japan on the [Chanpon blog](http://www.chanpon.org).

I haven't yet put together the identity analysis part. I need to noodle a bit more on this.
