[Reading in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/03/technology/03nano.html) about the health hazards of inhaling carbon nanotubes reminded me of [Snowcrash](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553380958/103-8465515-4761400?v=glance). I wonder what would happen if you inhaled [these RFID's](http://joi.ito.com/moblog/archives/005556.html).
