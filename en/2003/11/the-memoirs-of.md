Someone sent me a copy of "The Memoirs of Joi Ito". It came in from Canada without a return-address. (My assistant opened it.) It's a book based on The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes with all of the references to Sherlock Holmes replaced by "Joi Ito". It's from [www.customizedclassics.com](http://www.customizedclassics.com) which lets you create customized books like this. You can also customize the dedication. This books says:
> Dedicated to the world's most famous detective, who has yet to be discovered, a legend in his own mind, J.I.

I first thought it might be an advertisement from the company, but with this snarky dedication, I decided it must be someone I know. I asked [Boris](http://bopuc.levendis.com/RowBoat/), the main joker I know in Canada, but it wasn't him. Was it you [AG](http://accordionguy.blogware.com/)?

Anyway, haha. Very funny. ;-p
