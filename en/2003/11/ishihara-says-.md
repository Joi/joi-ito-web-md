> Koreans asked to be ruled by Japan, governor insists
>
> An unrepentant Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara on Friday reiterated claims that Koreans had chosen Japanese rule rather than face Chinese or Russian governance when Japan annexed the Korean Peninsula in 1910.
>
> Speaking at a regular news conference, Ishihara again claimed that political leaders on the Korean Peninsula had made the decision to accept Japanese rule, which lasted until Japan's defeat in World War II in 1945.
>
> According to Ishihara, Japan ruled its colony in a better fashion than Western nations, such as France, the Netherlands and the United States.

Ugh.
