So Larry may have been on the ropes for a few days, but he's back. He has a great proposal.

> Here is something you can do right now. In this NYT [op-ed](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/18/opinion/18LESS.html?ex=1043470800&en=97d153dccaa9d220&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND), I describe a proposal that would move more work into the public domain than a total victory in the Supreme Court would have. The basic idea is this: 50 years after a work has been “published,” a copyright owner would be required to pay a copyright tax. That tax should be extremely low--this proposal says $50, but it could be $1. If the copyright holder does not pay the tax for 3 years, then the work is forfeit to the public domain. If the copyright holder does pay the tax, then its contacting agent would be made a matter of public record. Very quickly we would have a cheap, searchable record, of what work is controlled and what work is free.

If Justice Breyer is right that only 2% of the work from the initial period affected by the Sonny Bono Act continues to have any commercial value at all, then this proposal would mean that all but 2% will move into the public domain within three years. And as the proposal applies to all work that is more than 50 years old, it would apply to a much larger range of work than would have been affected had we prevailed in the Supreme Court. This could give us (almost) everything we wante--98% of the public domain that our framers intended. Not bad for government work.There is an [FAQ](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/archives/EAFAQ.html) about the proposal. Also found [the infoAnarchy International movement to save the Public Domain](http://www.infoanarchy.org/story/2003/1/16/231332/420) on [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/2003_01_01_archive.html#90202203).
