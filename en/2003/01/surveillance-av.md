> iSee is an inverse surveillance application for wireless devices and web-browsers that enables users to monitor and avoid CCTV surveillance cameras. iSee users are presented with an interactive map showing the locations of known CCTV cameras in public space. Users click on the map to specify a point of origin and destination, and iSee employs artificial intelligence algorithms to determine a path of least surveillance between the two points that avoids as many cameras as possible.

So Cool! I want [iSee](http://www.appliedautonomy.com/isee/) built into my phone. I guess we could just write an i-Apli Java script to do it on our Docomo phones... hmm...
