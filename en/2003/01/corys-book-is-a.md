YES! Cory also puts his money where his mouth is. Good for him!

> Cory Doctorow’s brilliant novel, [Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom](http://craphound.com/down/), is out today. [Buy](http://craphound.com/down/buy.php) it early and often. Cory’s book is also the very first to be offered initially both for sale and under a [CreativeCommons](http://creativecommons.org) license. That means you can also download it for free. As Cory describes it,

“The entire text of my novel is available as a free [download](http://craphound.com/down/download.php) in a variety of standards-defined formats. No crappy DRM, no teasers, just the whole damned book.”

But as he (and I) expect, once you start the book, you’ll see you want it in its bound form. So again, you might as well [buy it](http://craphound.com/down/buy.php) too.
