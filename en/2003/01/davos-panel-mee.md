| Idei-san pondering the future of Japan... |

We had a meeting of the members participating the World Economic Forum panel at Davos on the Blueprint for Japan 2020. It's such a huge issue... I showed everyone [the picture that we drew](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/01/05/the_cycle_of_resistance_to_change_in_japan.html) (on my Mac... oops! ;-) ). Idei-san has been using the term "quantum leap" instead of "reform" and shared some of his views of Japan's problems with us. We still have some more homework to do before the panel, but I think we all agreed on the major points. I was appointed to be join [Heizo Takenaka](http://www.weforum.org/site/knowledgenavigator.nsf/Content/Takenaka%20Heizo), the Minister for Economic and Fiscal Policy and for Financial Services on his panel which will follow our panel. There are three panels on Japan and I'm the messenger from our panel to his. I wonder who's on the other panel. Anyway, we're the first one so I think we can set the tone.
