[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/davehawaii-thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/davehawaii.html)Today was a strange day. I had to give two presentations. The main one was to the Sony execs and other people that Sony had invited to the Sony Open Forum about the future of Japan. The discussion was extremely productive and I got a lot of feedback that will help us in Davos.

Then I walked next door to the Sheraton Waikiki to give a short presentation about Trust and Security in Ecommerce. It was a [Public Voice/OECD](http://www.thepublicvoice.org/events/honolulu03/program/) sort of thing that Marc Rotenberg was organizing. And there was [Dave Farber](http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/), a surprise guest. We gadget talked for awhile and IM'ed on our Sidekicks during the panel. It was fun to see Dave and I did the blog song/dance on him and he agreed to try it.

Later Mizuka and I were having cocktails with Chairman Idei of Sony at the Halekulani just standing around when out of nowhere appears [John Patrick](http://www.patrickweb.com/) and his wife. Hello! I knew John was in town for the GIP conference, but what a wonderfully random thing. He was off to give a talk somewhere so I made quick introductions.

It's really a small world... or everyone is in Hawaii today...
