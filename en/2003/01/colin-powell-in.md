Some notes from Colin Powell's talk.

Continue reading [Colin Powell in Davos](https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2003/01/26/colin-powell-in.html#more).

Colin Powell is turning the weapons inspection debate around and is saying that Iraq needs to account for the anthrax, the mobile labs, the delivery weapons and other weapons that the UN knows that it had. There are no tell-tale signs of disarmament. Iraq need to account for the weapons. The inspectors can't be expected to find the weapons. "Iraq must participate in disarmament process or be disarmed."

"We will not shrink from war if that is the only way to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction."

"United States has no intention of invading North Korea... At the same time, we keep all of our options on the table."

Powell, is a great speaker and very convincing. He should be the President of the United States. He made me feel more supportive of US actions with his remarks about the thought process behind his decisions.

Comment from a fellow GLT: "Maybe Bush made Powell say he wouldn't run for President since he is so much more eloquent and much more likely to be successful in creating partnerships in Europe that he would be a threat to Bush and undermine his power." Interesting thought. That may be true. If that is true, maybe Powell will run for President once it becomes evident that Bush will not be able to win the next election.
