I'm one of those people who hates reading books and hates writing stuff. I love talking to people and I do most of my thinking when I'm talking to someone or when I'm preparing to talk to someone. That's why I love blogs so much. I feel like I'm talking, not independantly cogitating.

Now my question. In a discussion, you're allow a certain amount of sloppiness and you mold your position and you develop a model together with whoever you talking to. I feel similarly when I blog. Having said that, what you write persists and you can get criticized for what you write. [Larry Lessig's blog is "tight".](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/) I mean, it's well thought out and non-sloppy. (He IS a law professor. ;-) ) On the other hand, [Marc Canter's blog](http://blogs.it/0100198/) is a bit more sloppy, but quite interesting. [Dave Winer](http://www.scripting.com/) seems to have mastered his style, a combination of short references, personal opinions and technical clarity.[Doc](http://doc.weblogs.com/), [Meg](http://www.megnut.com/), [Dan](http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/dan_gillmor/ejournal/), almost everyone on my blogroll has a pretty cool and unique style that works. One of my problems is that I think and talk differently depending on where I am and who I am with. This is helpful in providing myself with a variety of models that represent mutliple points of view when I think of an in issue. On the other hand, blogged, this turn into a mish mash of styles. Does this work? Can people filter the stuff that doesn't interest them? I assume they can.

I LOVE ["10 Tips on Writing for the Living Web"](http://www.alistapart.com/stories/writeliving/) It was a great help when I started blogging. Tip 3 is "Write Tight". So... that's my dilemma. Are people interested in the stream of consciousness sort of blogging I'm doing right now, or should it be tighter? Should I be MORE introverted and personal about my feelings, or more organized and intelligent. Is it OK to use my blog to think out loud? Do I have to check my spelling? ;-p Hmm...
