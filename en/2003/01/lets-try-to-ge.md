Ever since I started REALLY counting on my RSS feeds for my news, I realized that I read [Declan's Politech](http://www.politechbot.com/) and [David Farber's IP list](http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/) less. I took matters into my own hands and in the last week talked both David Farber and Declan into at least giving blogging a try. They were on the top of my list of mailing list operators who REALLY need to become bloggers. Please email Declan and Dave and give them your vote of support.

It's part of my new Switch campaign. RSS and MetaWeblogAPI for everyone. ;-)
