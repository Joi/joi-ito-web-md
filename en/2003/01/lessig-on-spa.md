I had just finished reading [Philip Jacob's piece](http://theory.whirlycott.com/~phil/antispam/rbl-bad/rbl-bad.html) and was preparing my thoughts for a panel on spam that I THINK I'm on in January when I saw this piece by Larry. It's great. It's right on and he's putting his job on the line. I totally agree. We CAN NOT give up the [stupid network](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/11/23/met_david_s_isenberg.html) just to stomp out spamming. I think that the label/punish idea is great. I only worry that the punishment loop is more difficult internationally. Maybe you'll end up with a lot of spam from Japanese, Chinese and Russian spammers. ;-) Larry will still keep his job though, because it will still be siginificantly less spam than you get now.

> A kind-hearted email and a nice analysis of spam have given me an idea:

First the analysis: Philip Jacob has a great piece about [spam and RBLs](http://theory.whirlycott.com/~phil/antispam/rbl-bad/rbl-bad.html). The essay not only identifies the many problems with RBLs, but it nicely maps a mix of strategies that could be considered in their place. But, alas, missing from the list is one [I've pushed](http://www.cioinsight.com/article2/0,3959,533225,00.asp): A law requiring simple labeling, and a bounty for anyone who tracks down spammers violating the law.

Then I got an email from a kind soul warning me about my work—"do you know how powerful your enemies are?" this person asked. No, I thought, I don't, but let's see. If I've got such powerful enemies, then I've got a good way to do some good.

Here goes: So (a) if a law like the one I propose is passed on a national level, and (b) it does not substantially reduce the level of spam, then (c) I will resign my job. I get to decide whether (a) is true; Declan can decide whether (b) is true. If (a) and (b) are both true, then I'll do (c) at the end of the following academic year.

So: Is there anyone else advancing a spam solution who would offer this kind of warranty?

*PS We've had this [discussion on spam on this blog before](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/06/28/spam.html) and my current position considering the technologies we have is that we use local whitelists (I use [tmda](http://www.tmda.net/)) instead of central blacklists.*
