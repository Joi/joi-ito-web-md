The results of [the poll](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/01/06/font_size_poll.html) asking whether people liked the new big font style were: YES=40 / NO=46 even though most of the comments in the item were supportive of the bigger fonts. I've set up the big font style sheet as the default, but have added the option to select either the polite (big font) style sheet or the cool (small font) style sheet. If you accept cookies, it will remember your preference once you've set it. Also, I stopped the poll because we discovered that the [micropoll script](http://technoerotica.net/micropoll.html) was not checking its input which is [a security risk](  http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/www-security-faq.html).
