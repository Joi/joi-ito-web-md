As the US starts to spin up towards the war, the bloggers are starting to take positions. One of the things that Larry Lessig and I talked about a lot was the feeling that it was OK to talk about politics on blogs. Well, as thoughts turn to feelings and feelings turn to action, I think that we will start testing and stressing the little network of blogs we call a home. When [I wrote about the Iranian round-up](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/12/20/_report_up_to_1000_mideast_immigrants_jailed_yesterday_in_so_ca_.html), I found some of my good friends disagreeing with me and even got email pointing out the irony of discussing US problems on a Japanese blog. [Kuro5hin has an article bashing O'Keefe human shield.](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/1/17/42816/8593) What's interesting is that just because we all agree on copyright, open standards and MetaWeblog API, it doesn't mean that we all have the same politics. I've generally been avoiding the topic of war and the peace movement and have been feeling VERY guilty that I haven't been writing more about [Lisa Rein's activities in protesting the treatment of immigrants.](http://www.onlisareinsradar.com/archives/immigrant_roundups/index.php) I just sensed that it was a "hot" area and that I needed to prepare before going there…

Over the last few months I've heard arguments from some of the most persuasive pro-war advocates. My belief after hearing the arguments is that the war will probability be a long war with lots of stuff to do afterwards. (No clear opposition group in Iraq to rebuild Iraq after they oust Hussein.) If you consider the cost (human and financial) of what happens after the beginning of the war it's just not worth it. It looks to me like a re-election campaign for GW Bush causing America to make a very stupid decision which will cost the world money and grief. This is another Vietnam. I am against the war and anyone who is not should think carefully about the motives of the president of the United States and think step-by-step about what happens to freedom in the US after Total Information Awareness spins up and what happens in Iraq and the rest of the world after you have started the war. THINK ABOUT IT.
