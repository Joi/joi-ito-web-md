Had lunch with Ejovi Nuwere today. He's a friend of Ken who used to work for me and they did some security work together. Ejovi has a new book, [Hacker Cracker](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0066210798/qid=1042001703/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-8627404-7925759?v=glance&s=books) which was picked up in [Wired News recently](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,56712,00.html). It's an amazing story about Ejovi who grew up Brooklyn's Bed-Stuy and how a tech oriented kid used computers to build his life. He's lived in Japan and is now here writing some articles getting more and more into policy and privacy related issues. We had a lot of interests in common and it's great to meet a like-minded person from a very different background. He's got [a blog](http://www.ejovi.net) and a [site for his book](http://www.hackercracker.net).
