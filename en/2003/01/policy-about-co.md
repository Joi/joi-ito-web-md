I have had to remove two sets of comments from my blog since I've started. Both of them slandered the people who I wrote about and both were written from fake email addresses. Here is my policy on comments on my blog. Feel free to criticize governments, products, companies or me. Criticism about other people should be written from a verifiable email address and should contain logical arguments about policy, technical or other arguments and positions taken by the person being criticized. Slanderous comments intended to be hurtful rather than constructive will not be tolerated. If you want to post something that might appear slanderous or blow the whistle on something where you feel the fear of retribution, please email me directly. If you can convince me that it is important to get your message out, I will protect your identity and will post the item.

Thank you for your understanding. I was wondering when this was going to start happening...
