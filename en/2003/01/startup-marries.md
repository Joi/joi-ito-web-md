Moblogs going commercial. [Marc](http://blogs.it/0100198/2003/01/08.html#a495) and [Dave](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/01/08#When:5:54:33AM) talk about how moblogging should support the [MetaWeblog API](http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi). I agree. Having said that, I think many carriers will go try to build the whole shooting match on their own. They don't understand the value of the community or the tools. At least in Japan, carriers are very cocky and relatively well funded so I bet they will go it on their own, generally. (Not that I won't try to get them to use open standards.) I think another more interesting target are people who don't have a network of their own. People like digital camera companies, hiptop device companies (Danger and Good), and cell phone companies like Nokia and [Sony Ericsson](http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?page=start&ver=portalpage). Anyway, doing a simple moblog is easy. (Posting pictures from a phone.) Making it REALLY interesting is going to be very exciting involving hardware, firmware, embedded software, DSP's, wireless technology, camera technology, identity, voice, privacy, security, GPS, IM and LOTS of other stuff.

A Dublin-based start-up is to offer software to mobile operators that will enable mobile phone users to create and maintain Weblogs or "blogs" using only their phones. *The article about [The NewBay FoneBlog](http://www.newbay.com/products_general.html) originally appeared in [electricnews.net](http://www.electricnews.net/news.html?code=8879871).*
