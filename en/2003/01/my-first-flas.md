I've been meaning to learn flash ever since Josh Davis called me "old school" during the Prix Ars Electronica jury meeting last year for discounting the importance of flash. With the cool political flash statements as well as some of the silly ones, I've been feeling more and more that flash might be an interesting medium for me if I could learn to use it well. So... On the flight back from Hawaii, I wrote my first flash "thingie". I don't even know what you call flash stories. I used Adobe LiveMotion... Anyway, technically, it's really stupid and simple and I wasn't going to publish it. A few people suggested that I post it anyway, and knowing myself, I think publishing is probably the best pressure/incentive for me to learn/do more.

It's 372K. It's a little slide show of people I've met recently and how they are influencing my thoughts about "IT"... (not information technology, but the BIG "IT")
