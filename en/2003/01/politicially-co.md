In my entry about style, Cory commented on the difficulty of reading tiny grey fonts. I've gotten a lot of this kind of feedback. So... I just changed the style sheet. I made the fonts all default size and black. Tell me what you think. Actually, on most browsers, if you do a command-"-" and reduce the size of the fonts, it looks like it used to. Now it is a bit more flexible on the browsers that don't let you resize fonts defined absolutely in the style sheet. On the other hand, it looks a bit more childish in defalut mode. Your feedback would be greatly appreciated. (I wish there was a polling feature in MT. Does anyone know of a polling feature that I can use on my site in situations like this?)
