I told [Hirata](http://uva.jp/dh/mt/archives/000323.html) that Howard and I had been talking about giving comments more attention on blogs. I thought that having an RSS feed for comments would be very useful. A few minutes later, he made one for me. Thanks Hirata! So I have an RSS feed for comments to my [English blog](http://joi.ito.com/comments.rdf) and my [Japanese blog](http://joi.ito.com/jp/comments.rdf).
