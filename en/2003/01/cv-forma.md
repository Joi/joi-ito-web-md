Regarding [Dave Winer's post about looking for a job in academia](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/01/01#When:4:59:33PM) (which I think is perfect for Dave), [Phil Wolff writes the following.](http://dijest.com/aka/2003/01/02.html#a2304)

Start by acknowledging that CVs are made from microcontent. Then...

1. Support HR-XML résumé protocol, syndicate CVs via RSS.   
2. Create a blogging user and programmatic interface for creating and maintaining a CV.   
3. Make it easy to associate posts with specific jobs, projects, and skills.   
4. Make job availability clearly visible. A big "ah ha!" I've always had trouble keeping my CV up to date. This would be very cool. In any event, I am going to start by moving my CV over to a Radio Outline RIGHT NOW.
