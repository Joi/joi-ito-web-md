One amazing phenomenon of blogs is that because of all of the linking going on they end up with fairly high google rankings. At [Supernova](http://www.pulver.com/supernova/), [Cory of Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/) talked about how people email him asking about things he blogs because his blog entries show up on the top of Google results. Also at Supernova, Sergey Brin co-founder of Google talked about how important the ranking and results algorithms were for Google. For instance, first result for "suicide" can have a life or death impact on someone depending on whether it is a page to help you decide not to commit suicide or a page about how to commit suicide. I am the second entry for "Japan + Dayton Ohio" and #3 for "Takenaka media" for instance. At Davos, I talked to Larry Page, co-founder of Google about the phenomenon. I explained that I was very excited that [my entry about how the media failed to report the public support of Takenaka](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/10/30/polls_show_japanese_media_is_wrong_about_opinion_on_takenaka.html) showed up before the media reports. I mentioned that maybe it was the way blogs created a lot of pages and linked to each other a lot and how this was giving them unfair juice. Larry said he thought that blogs were getting higher rankings because they were becoming a more important part of the Internet and implied that he felt the high rankings were fair. Cool. I was beginning to feel a bit guilty about the high rankings and worried that Google would "figure it out" and start lowering the rankings for blogs. If Larry says they're fair, I'm assuming they're fair and I don't have to worry about a "correction" in my page ranking.

So, if anyone knows of a good Japanese teacher in Dayton, please send email to Bettina. *She gave me permission to post her email...*
