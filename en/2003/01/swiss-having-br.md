[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/swiss-thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/swiss.html)So I was talking to [Zai](http://www.etoy.com/) on the way to the Zurich AirportUnique and told him that I had heard that Munich Airport was closer to Davos than Zurich and that maybe I should have gone that way. He said that ever since the Swiss changed the name of the Zurich Airport to Unique, people mistake it with Munich. Why did they change it in the first place? Zurich Airport sounds just fine to me. Now, they are chaning Swiss Air to just "Swiss". Pretty confusing. What is the point? [Monorom](http://www.etoy.com/) sent me a [funny web page about all of this.](http://www.eusebio.ch/uniqueswiss.htm)
