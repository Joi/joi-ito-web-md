[Michael from Danger says](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/12/27/moblogging_resources.html) that they have been moblogging internally since the launch and I think that some of the code from HipTop Nation came from Michael. Michael, is this the same code you are running on Hiplog? Anyway, congratulations. This is great. Bridging the gap between hardware companies and the Net...

[Danger, Inc.](http://www.hiptop.com) is finally catching up with its fan base, launching [Hiplog](http://www.hiptop.com/hiplog/) for users of the Danger Hiptop to moblog — months after [HipTop Nation](www.hiptop.bedope.com/) was launched by Danger HipTop enthusiasts.

(Thanks, [Fabio](http://www.freegorifero.com)!)
> Got a hiptop? Then spit it out!

Hiplog is blogging by hiptop. Send email from your hiptop to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). The subject of your message becomes the title of your hiplog entry. The text of your message become the text of the entry. Want to make your hiplog a photojournal? Take snapshots with your hiptop and send them to hiplog. It's as easy as sending email.Posted by Howard at 10:54 AM
