Hey Dave, when do we get to start using newMediaObject?

Enter the (proposed) [metaWeblog.newMediaObject](http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$2393) method. As Joi [writes](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/01/09/answer_to_marcs_question_about_how_our_moblog_works.html):

Once Dave lifts the [caveat](http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$2393#caveat), we'll support metaWeblog.newMediaObject in the next Movable Type release.
