> It's true, it's true. I've been offered a fellowship at the [Berkman Center for Internet & Society](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Law School, and have, of course, accepted. It's a very exciting opportunity. Check out this [section](http://davenet.userland.com/2003/01/06/firstEssayOfTheYear#notJustJournalism) of yesterday's DaveNet for an idea of what we're going to work on. And of course over the coming weeks and months I'll write more. I'm going to spend a lot of time in Cambridge this year. Totally looking forward. *Onward!*
