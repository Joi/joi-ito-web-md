![e2c_leftbar1.jpg](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/e2c_leftbar1.jpg)The [Shure E2c "in-ear" headphones](http://www.shure.com/earphones/eseries_accessories.asp) are the best headphones I've ever used. They come with foam earplug style or rubber sleeves. They fit right inside of your ear like a hearing aid and the wire slips over your ear and down behind your back. There is no electronic noise cancellation, but the earplug-like sleeves shut out all outside sound and give you incredible sound with no outside noise. Absolutely incredible. My ipod experience just got one notch closer to a religious experience.

*Thanks Barak!*
