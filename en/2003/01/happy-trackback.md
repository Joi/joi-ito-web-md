I was dreaming about trackbacks this morning (really) and I was thinking about how cool the [Blog Snowball Fight](http://www.excessbloggage.com/tracy/archives/week_2002_12_22.html#002552) was. Then I realized that of COURSE you should trackback ping your friend with your greetings.

So Happy Blog New Year everyone! Here's to making blogs a bigger and bigger part of the freedom of ideas and creating a global dialog for a blog enabled global community and a more democratic world.
