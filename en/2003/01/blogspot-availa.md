I appears that one blog, [DynaWeb](http://dweb.blogspot.com/) was the concern of the Chinese government ([I read this first on Dave Winer's Weblog](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/01/16#When:5:54:08AM)) which had information about how to get around the government filters. According to the DynaWeb site, Blogger/Blogspot seems to be available again with only DynaWeb's DNS being screwed up by the government poinpointing the target. According the DynaWeb, it was [an article in Forbes by Juliana Liu](http://www.forbes.com/home_asia/newswire/2003/01/15/rtr847318.html) that pushed the Chinese government to remove the filter on Blogspot.
