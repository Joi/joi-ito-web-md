> "The problem is one of correlation vs causation. Research has been done correlating being statistically obese with a shorter expected life span. In more detailed studies found a stronger correlation with lack of activity and a short life span than being fat. So if you exercise and stay fit but can't lose pounds don't fret. You're likely more healthy than your thin couch potato friends."

So for someone exercises regularly, but is fat, this is good news. I'll live long, but I'll probably still be fat. Now all we need is, "Survey shows fat people are considered more attractive in light of recent survey that they live longer..." ;-p
