Shannon's [just blogged](http://www.shannoncampbell.info/archives/000677.htm) about a song that I asked her to write for [Ben](http://btrott.typepad.com/) and [Mena](http://mena.typepad.com/) for their birthdays. (In case you've ever wondered, the reason their company is called Six Apart is because they're birthdays are six days apart...) Shannon went above and beyond the call of duty and did a most amazing job. In order to get the humor/wit balance just right, she read everything Ben and Mena had ever blogged and probably knows more about them now than even the most dedicated stalker.

She ended up with a song called ["Your Own Dot Org."](http://joi.ito.com/images2/ShannonCampbell-YourOwnDotOrg.mp3) I love it. Creative Commons [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 1.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/) deed of course.

Thanks again for this great work and welcome back, wherever you've been Shannon. Your [new site](http://www.shannoncampbell.info/journal/) looks great. Now come and hang out with us again on [#joiito](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel). ;-)

Lyrics follow.
