Last year, I saw [Liz Lawley link](http://mamamusings.net/archives/2002/10/30/i_want_this_apron.php) to an [Apron with an Apple Base Station that said "All Your Base Station Are Belong To Us."](http://www.cafeshops.com/cp/prod.aspx?p=geekculture3.2467419) I thought it was really funny and bought one for my sister. Ever since then, I've seen references to, and have used myself on occasion, this funny grammatically flawed assertion.

Last night, [Rojisan](http://www.rojisan.com/blog/) asked me if I knew where this phrase came from. I didn't. He told me that it came from a mistranslation in a Japanese video game. ??? This morning I saw a link on [RageBoy's page](http://www.rageboy.com/index2.html) to an [ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US flash animation](http://www.scene.org/redhound/AYB.swf). (My first exposure to the images from the actual video game.) A quick Google produced [a Wired News article](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,42009,00.html) explaining that the game is called Zero Wing from 1989 for the Sega Genesis.
