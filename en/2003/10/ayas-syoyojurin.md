[![](http://joi.ito.com/images/aya-tm.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/images/aya.jpg)[Ryuichi Sakamoto](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/09/13/ryuichi_sakamoto.html) sent me an email asking me to make people aware of a movement to get Aya's Shoyo-Jurin, an Evergreen Oak forest in Japan selected as a World Heritage site and help protect this very important forest. Check out the web page if you're interested in [forests](http://www.bunkahonpo.or.jp/aya/index_eng.htm). It's an amazing place that I hope to visit soon.
