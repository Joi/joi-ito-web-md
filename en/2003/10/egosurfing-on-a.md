You've all probably read by now, but Amazon has added a feature that allows you to search the full text of over 120,000 books. Totally amazing. Now tell the truth everyone (so I don't look totally vain), how many of you have [ego-surfed](http://www.netlingo.com/lookup.cfm?term=ego-surfing) Amazon already? I searched for "joichi ito" and "joi ito". I got 8 [results for "joichi ito"](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index%3Dstripbooks%26field-keywords%3D%252522joichi%252520ito%252522) and 1 for ["joi ito"](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index%3Dstripbooks%26field-keywords%3D%252522joi%252520ito%252522). The weird thing is that other than [Timothy Leary's book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0914171801) and [John C. Lilly's](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0914171720) book, I have never heard of any of the other books. Also, the few books that I do know I'm mentioned in did now show up. I wonder if they are scanning books that don't sell well first. ;-) I DID find out that I have the honor of being in [a "For Dummies" book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764505467).

How can I NOT buy this book to find out what they said about me. Ack!
