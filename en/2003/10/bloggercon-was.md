Bloggercon was fun. It was great meeting so many of the bloggers I read and finding them just as interesting in person as I could ever have hoped. I'm not going to make a list of people who I met because I'm going to forget to mention someone if I try. If this were Japan, I would have a business card from everyone I met and could easily make a list. I wonder why the business card thing hasn't become more ubiquitous in the West...

Anyway, thanks [Dave](http://www.scripting.com/) and everyone else who made [bloggercon](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/) possible.
