I will be facilitating a session today on community at [Bloggercon](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/) at 1:30pm. I'll be on [IRC](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel) so drop by if you're free. Some talking notes [here](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/BloggerConCommunity).

UPDATE: Thanks for everyone that dropped in. It was a lot of fun. Special thanks to [Kevin Marks](http://epeus.blogspot.com/) for the tech and other support. [Picture on Bloggercon page.](http://bloggercon.blogware.com/blog/Photos/_archives/2003/10/5/3899.html)
