> [Douglas Rushkoff](http://www.rushkoff.com/blog.php), in cooperation with UK think-tank Demos, is publishing a short book next week called "[Open Source Democracy](http://www.rushkoff.com/2003_09_01_archive.php#106436361185233341 ":: Douglas Rushkoff - Weblog ::")". He's giving away [a PDF version of the book](http://www.demos.co.uk/opensourcedemocracy_pdf_media_public.aspx "PDF version of 'Open Source Democracy'") for free, though, with permission to republish it in whatever format you like, so go nuts. Those of you in the UK can also attend [a lecture](http://www.demos.co.uk/projects/OpenSourceDemocracy_page293.aspx) Rushkoff will be giving in London on the subject.

Looks cool. [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org/) license and everything. I'm going to read this on the plane back to Japan...
