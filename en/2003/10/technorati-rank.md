To make my point here, I have first admit that I often go to the [Technorati top 100 page](http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/top100.html) to see where my blog is ranked. I admit that it goes against my negative feelings about the power law, etc. and is a bit self-absorbed.

Anyway, when Technorati added Live Journal and surged in indexed blogs, my ranking dropped enormously and I was barely still on the list. Lately, I've slowly crawled back up. Recently I've been neck to neck with a blog called "[:: i don't give a shit what you think ::](http://www.gaijindesign.com/lawriemalen) ". It felt weird seeing, "I don't give a shit what you think Joi Ito's Web." ;-) I just noticed that I finally passed it. The funny thing about this list is that I seem to have (in my mind) a relationship to blogs close to me in ranking. I tend to read them to see who they are. I see some blogs slip down the list, and some others shoot up. I try to find what causes their rise and fall by looking at their [Technorati cosmos](http://www.technorati.com/resultshelp.html).

Am I weird?
