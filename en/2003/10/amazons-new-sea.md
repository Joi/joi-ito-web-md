> Amazon.com Inc. is invading Google's turf with a new online search engine company that hopes to pluck some of the profits pouring into the rapidly growing sector.
>
> Seattle-based Amazon has dubbed its search startup "A9" and set up offices in Palo Alto, not far from Google's Mountain View headquarters. A9 hopes to launch in October with 30 employees and grow much larger as it develops a search engine that will be licensed to other Web sites, said spokeswoman Alison Diboll.

I wonder if this is going to be an html scraper or a web service/feed aggregator? I wonder if it will be the mother-of-all referral/affiliate marketing aggregators... but how can they do search and not compete with the business model of "all roads lead to Amazon"? I wonder if A9 means it's their 9th try...

In any event, writing a search engine from scratch at the dawn of real web services sounds like a lot of fun.
