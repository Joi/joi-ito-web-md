Ross Mayfield [rants](http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2003/10/indirect_democr.html) about the problems of direct democracy and the difference between [emergent democracy](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/EmergentDemocracy) and direct democracy. This was one of the points that I had difficulty making during [the Harvard Law School class.](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/10/06/speaking_at_the_digital_democracy_class_at_the_harvard_law_school_tuesday.html) [Rojisan](http://www.rojisan.com/blog/) and I talked about it last night too. Emergent democracy IS NOT the same as using technology to scale direct democracy. Emergent democracy is about leadership through giving up control, activating the people to engage through deliberation and action, and allowing emergent order to grow from the grass roots. It's the difference between a couch potato clicking the vote button and a group of people starting their own Dean [coalition group](http://www.deanforamerica.com/site/PageServer?pagename=community_home).

That's the difference between the [Dean Campaign](http://www.deanforamerica.com/) and what just happened in California. They may both be symptoms of people unhappy with the current regime, but they are very different types of democracy.
