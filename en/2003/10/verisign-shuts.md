After ICANN's [formal letter](http://www.icann.org/correspondence/twomey-to-lewis-03oct03.htm) asking Verisign to shut down Site Finder, VeriSign has temporarily shut the service down. [They don't sound very happy](http://finance.lycos.com/qc/news/story.aspx?story=35926511) about shutting down a "service has been well received by millions of Internet users". Good job on this one ICANN.
