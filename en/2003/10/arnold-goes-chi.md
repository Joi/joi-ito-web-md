[![schwarz4.jpg](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/schwarz4.jpg)](http://homepage.mac.com/alan31/clips/schwarz4.mov)The [entry on Bopuc's blog](http://bopuc.levendis.com/RowBoat/archives/-2003/10/21/absurd.php) about [Japander.com](http://www.japander.com/) reminded me of [my blog entry about my favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger commercials](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/09/07/japandercom_american_stars_doing_silly_japanese_commercials.html) in Japan for energy drinks. This is also relevant to the [entry about Lost in Translation](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/10/04/lost_in_translation.html) since Bill Murray's role is probably what Arnold had to go through. Anyway, definitely worth a look if you haven't seen these commercials already. They're great.
