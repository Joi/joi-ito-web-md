I will be speaking about [emergent democracy](http://joi.ito.com/static/emergentdemocracy.html) at the [Digital Democracy class](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/digitaldemocracy/syllabus.html) at the Harvard Law School Tuesday. Thanks to [Ethan](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/home/ethan_zuckerman) and [Andrew](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/mclaughlin.html) for setting this up. Looks like a lot of fun.

UPDATE: We'll have IRC on the screen so drop by [#joiito](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel/) if you want to participate. We'll also try to set up a video feed from Boris's Mac. It's at the Berkman Center (Baker House) from 5pm-7pm.
