Loic, a French entrepreneur blogger [writes about](http://www.u-blog.net/loic/note/49833) his experience starting companies. Good stuff. I totally agree with the importance of execution over ideas. That's why, although I find my "competition" reads my blog, it's better if people know what I'm doing as long as I'm moving fast enough. ;-)
