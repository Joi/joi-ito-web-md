[![](http://joi.ito.com/images2/withlilly-tm.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/images2/withlilly.jpg)When I mentioned on [my post about ego-surfing Amazon](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/10/24/egosurfing_on_amazon_search_inside_the_book.html) that I wished I could see more context around where my name showed up in the books, [Andy Baio](http://www.waxy.org/) [pointed out in the comments](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/10/24/egosurfing_on_amazon_search_inside_the_book.html#n010934) that you could click on the page number and see the actual page. (Although RIO [points out later](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/10/24/egosurfing_on_amazon_search_inside_the_book.html#n010936) that Amazon needs your credit card number before they let you do that.)

Anyway, I was looking at the various pages and found this picture taken by Philip Bailey of [John C. Lilly](http://eccosys.jp/lilly/) with Barbara Lilly, Kazuo and me in [The Scientist: A Metaphysical Autobiography by John Lilly](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0914171720/002-3642431-3566421). I'm sporting Anarchic Adjustment threads which were [hip at the time](http://www.southern.com/MMM/fashion.html) and I was helping to distribute in Japan. If I remember correctly, they were having a conference about John C. Lilly's work in Tokyo. I remember lots of academics talking on and on about John Lilly and his work. When John was asked to make a comment at the end, he said, "you all know much more about me than I can remember so I don't have much to add. My forgetery is much bigger than my memory." I remember thinking that was very funny. John Lilly was a very smart and very funny man. I miss him.

It's kind of strange thinking about the path that this photo has taken. I remember Philip taking it, I think I remember seeing a print. Then it got published, printed, scanned, searched, downloaded and now blogged. I assume the copyright holder is Philip Bailey and I assume he doesn't mind me posting this.

PS: Philip, I can't seem to find your email address or your web page. If you see this, can you email me?
