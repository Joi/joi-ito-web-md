I was messing around surfing Google, trying to test something [Dave Sifry](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/) told me about. The theory was that you actually couldn't get to all of the thousands of results Google says it has when you search for something. I searched for stuff and simply paged forward and found that in fact you did reach an end of search results rather quickly. The number varied so I tried it with "repeat search with omitted results." I found that you can get to exactly result number 999 and no results show after that. I felt like Jim Carrey in [The Truman Show](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/)...

UPDATE: According to [Adam Hill](http://randompixels.typepad.com/) on IRC, it was on the [Google Weblog](http://google.blogspace.com/) too, but I can't seem to find the entry.
