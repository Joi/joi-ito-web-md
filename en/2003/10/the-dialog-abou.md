My [original blog entry](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/10/14/homeland_security_at_the_border.html) about Trevor's fiance Beate's treatment when trying to enter the US is starting to sink into my archives, but the dialog continues. Both Beate and Tervor have commented. Trevor's brother [Dan has a blog](http://landofthefree.blogspot.com/). [Dan Gillmor's blog](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001413.shtml#001413) and the [British Expats blog](http://britishexpats.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&postid=1020488) also have extensive comments.

Both in my blog and Dan Gillmor's blog, people have made sort of insensitive comments about the couple before the couple commented. Important lesson: People you think about in third person can read blogs and have a voice. "They" are real people. I think it's great that we're able to have such an open dialog about stuff like this with the people who were actually involved. I know many people at the embassies read blogs. What do you folks think? You should chime in. ;-)
