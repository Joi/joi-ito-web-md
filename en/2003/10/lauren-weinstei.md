Lauren Weinstein, Co-Founder of People For Internet Responsibility ([PFIR](http://www.pfir.org/)) and the moderator of [PRIVACY Forum](http://www.vortex.com/) just started a [blog](http://neon.vortex.com/blog/lauren/). He's [not sure whether blogs are a good thing yet](http://neon.vortex.com/blog/lauren/archive/000004.html), but lets hope he keeps it up. He's one of the important mailing list guys that I've been try to convert to blogging. [Dave Farber and Declan are two others](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/01/15/lets_try_to_get_declan_and_david_farber_to_blog.html). ;-)
