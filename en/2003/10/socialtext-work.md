[Socialtext](http://www.socialtext.com/) [announced](http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20031021005100&newsLang=en) the released version 1.0 of their workspace package. It's groupware thingie for enterprise. I'm using it for a lot of my workgroups. It's basically a wiki with a blog-like feature that sort of looks nice and has login, which makes it not really a wiki, but not a blog... I guess it's a workplace. Anyway, as you know, I love this kind of alchemy.

They also announced Kwikspace based on [Kwiki](http://www.kwiki.org/) as an open source project.
