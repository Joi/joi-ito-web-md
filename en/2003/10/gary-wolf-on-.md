I had a really interesting IM chat with [Gary](http://www.aether.com/) this morning. He's writing an article for Wired about the Internet side of the Dean campaign. He's [blogging about it as well](http://www.aether.com/archives//000016.html). Very cool. It looks like he's having a lot of interesting conversations. A must read [blog entry](http://www.aether.com/archives//000016.html), which will probably lead to a great article. Like [Dan Gillmor](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/) and [Jeff Jarvis](http://www.buzzmachine.com/), he is another journalists who seems to understand the value of blogging. And... free fact checking. ;-)
