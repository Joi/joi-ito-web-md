Tim Oren [rants](http://www.pacificavc.com/blog/2003/09/30.html#a381) about how metadata is NOT the next big thing. He quotes Cory's 2001 often cited [Metacrap](http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm) rant. Both good rants. But I disagree. I think that blogging tools allows the producer of the content to enter metadata about the micro-content much more easily than ever before. If you're writing about a book, you'll enter the ISBN number because you want to get the cover art and the affiliate link to Amazon. You'll insert the GIS info into a picture you take on your camera phone because it's just one button away. You'll create your FOAF file so you can search for friends of friends near you. I agree that the discussion about the name spaces and the semantics is messy, but I think it's silly to write off metadata as a pipe dream. Have been to [All Consuming](http://www.allconsuming.net/) lately? How do you think that works? [MusicBrainz](http://www.musicbrainz.org/) and [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org) are also non-metacrap metadata projects.
