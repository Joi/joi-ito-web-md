Spent the weekend in Kyoto "offline" with [Loic](http://u-blog.net/loic) and a few other friends. I decided to focus on the logistics and not spend time trying to blog. Loic's got some stuff on his site about the trip. I've got a bunch of stuff that I need to blog from my trip in DC, etc. Hope to get it all up here in the next day or so.
