[![](http://joi.ito.com/images2/broggers-tm.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/images2/broggers.jpg)A new Japanese book on blogging is about to come out called "Bloggers! Vol. 1" which you can [pre-order on Amazon.co.jp](http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4798105767/ref=sr_aps_b_/250-0816871-7897024). The action heros on the cover, especially the guy with the poopie thing on his head, are a bit weird, but the authors and the publisher, [Shoeisha](http://www.shoeisha.co.jp/) are reputable in Japan. (I hope the yellow guy with the poopie mark isn't supposed to be me...) I haven't seen the actual book yet, but I'll get a few extra copies to bring to [ETech](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/). ;-) There's a dialog between Howard Rheingold and me (I had totally forgotten about this. It was a taped dinner conversation...) , and an interview with "the developers of Movable Type". It looks like there's an article about Blosxom as well.
