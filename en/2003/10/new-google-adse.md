[Russell Beattie](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1004598.html), [Jason Kottke](http://www.kottke.org/03/10/031003the_first_ru.html), [Cory](http://boingboing.net/2003_10_01_archive.html#106520492760792076) and [Aaron](http://google.blogspace.com/archives/001049) blog about the new Terms of Service for Google [AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/). AdSense is a way to allow you to sell advertising space on your own site to advertisers using Google [AdWords](http://www.google.com/ads/). It's a cool service for blogs with lots of traffic to allow people to earn a little money.

The new Terms of Service allow Google to easily cancel your account and several people have complained that they have been shutdown unfairly. More importantly, the new terms do not allow you to talk about AdSense in public or to contact any of the advertisers directly. This seems to go against Sergey Brin's Google rule #1: "Don't be Evil."

I think I remember Google saying at the beginning that they wouldn't do advertising... I guess I remember when Infoseek used to charge the user to search. ;-) Things change... But I hope Google realizes that stifling free speech about part of its service is evil and also stupid.
