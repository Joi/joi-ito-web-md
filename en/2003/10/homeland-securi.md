Horrible story. I was also harassed at the border this time, much worse than I've ever been. I have a zillion stamps in my passport and it's obvious that I travel frequently to the US, but the questions were quite relentless. The Homeland Security officer was really tough on everyone and when it was turn for the Japanese woman in front of me to go up, she was so frightened, she was shaking and couldn't even speak. He kept asking her name and she opened her mouth and nothing came out. I haven't seen anyone so scared.

Anyway, for anyone traveling to the US... It's TOTALLY different now. I may have just hit a particularly tough guy, but the mood is totally different now. The questions are totally different now. Be prepared to explain everything about your trip, your history, your nationality and your job in great detail. My guy this trip didn't know what a venture capitalist was so I had to explain that too...

I think I'm going to start cutting back my travel to the US. I definitely don't want to end up in some jail with no food for 20 hours... The US might as well put up a sign saying, "your trip may be randomly terminated for security purposes..."
