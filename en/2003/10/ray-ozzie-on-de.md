Exactly.

Email is breaking, breaking, [broken](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/08/14/email_is_officially_broken.html). [Adriaan has a neat graph](http://www.kung-foo.tv/blog/archives/000623.php#000623).

Ray links to [Clay](http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2003/10/01/gelernter_on_email_overload.php) and [Ross](http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2003/10/01/the_end_of_the_web_as_we_know_it.php) who link to [Gelernter](http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/144yvpss.asp) and [Hornik](http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2003/000191.html) on the issue.
