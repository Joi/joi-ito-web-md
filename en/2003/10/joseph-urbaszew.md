Joseph Urbaszewski, a teacher who lives near the fire is [blogging about](http://homepage.mac.com/joeurbz/iblog/index.html) the fire and has become a clearinghouse of information. It appears to be more up-to-date than the mass media.

There is also a [live scanner feed](http://xgen.caliberstreams.com/mcasx.asx?media=4005&package=2207) where you can listen to the overworked, heroic firemen fighting the fire.

response from the base station? "get their name, date of  
birth, and the phone number of their dentist"!!*Thanks for the info and links Kevin, and hope you are safe.*
