> The piece says he rubs shoulders with Timothy Leary . Ooops. Did I read that correctly? Leary died in 1996 and if he's rubbing shoulders at all it's with the fishes.

Actually, [Tim lives on in cyberspace and I rub shoulders with him there.](http://www.leary.com/home/guided_tour/) ;-)

UPDATE: [Metroactive article](http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/06.13.96/public-eye-9624.html) about Tim living on in cyberspace. *Thanks for [the link](http://joi.ito.com/archives/1995/03/20/hanging_out_with_timothy_leary.html#n010871) [Bill](http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/FrontPage)!*
