[I wrote about page slapping in August](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/08/10/page_slapping.html) in the context of IRC. [Grant](http://grant.henninger.name/) just [chumped](http://www.peerfear.org/chump/joiito/) that Wired Jargon Watch [just listed it](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.11/start.html?pg=4) in the context of email. I wonder who coined the word.
