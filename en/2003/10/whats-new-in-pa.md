[Mark Pilgrim](http://diveintomark.org/) just posted [a tour of Panther](http://diveintoosx.org/panther/), the new Mac OS X release. I'm supposed to be getting in the office today so I'll be spending the weekend doing a fresh install and reading Mark's guide.

Update: Since Panther shipped today for many people, it appears that Mark's site is receiving a self-inflicted denial-of-service attack...
