Wired just [ran an article](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.11/nodes.html?pg=2&topic=&topic_set=) casting me as "The Tokyo Node". [Clay](http://www.shirky.com/) is "The Tech Node" and [Linda Stone](http://research.microsoft.com/vwg/people/linda.htm) is "The Valley Node". I'd say that's pretty good company. It says we secretly run the world. It's not true. Really.

A few clarifications... I didn't "head" the "[Blueprint for Japan 2020](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/15/video_clip_of_my_rant_on_the_blueprint_for_japan_2020_panel_in_davos.html)" this year but was just a rather big node in a team and I wouldn't call [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org) a "digital archive and copyleft think tank". Also, it was [Tony Kobayashi](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/11/01/talk_at_doyukai.html) who [took me to the Trilateral Commission Annual Meeting](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/04/09/trilateral_commission_speech.html) to repeat my Davos Japan dinner rant later that year although [Idei-san](http://joi.ito.com/moblog/archives/005921.html) invited me to the [Sony Open Forum to rant](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/01/15/strange_day_dave_farber_and_john_patrick_magically_appear.html) on.

Anyway... details details... Thanks for the nice write-up Jeff.

UPDATE: I was [first mentioned](http://joi.ito.com/archives/1993/07/01/howard_mentioned_me_in_wired.html) in Wired in [an article in Wired 1.03 about MUDs](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.03/muds.html?pg=4&topic=) in 1993 by [Howard Rheingold](http://www.rheingold.com/index.html).
