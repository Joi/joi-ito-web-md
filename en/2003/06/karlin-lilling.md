Karlin Lillington was at my small session at the ISC conference in St. Gallen where I talked about Emergent Democracy. I think she was the only blogger at session and she's written [a very nice piece](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103966/stories/2003/06/03/bloggingAtTheCentreOfEmergingDemocracy.html) about the session for *The Irish Times*. Thanks Karlin!
