On June 11, we released a report on privacy technology and legistlation that was the product of a great deal of work by experts around the world. It was funded by the Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications of Japan. I am urging them to make this an ongoing effort with annual updates. If you read the report and found it useful, please [email me](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e18b88958ea18f848e95848f98cf828e8c) or post something here so I can pass on the praise to the Ministry. ;-)

The report can be [found on my wiki.](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/PrivacyReport)
