[Professor Shumpei Kumon](http://www.glocom.ac.jp/users/shumpei/shumpei.e.html) of [Glocom](http://www.glocom.ac.jp/top/index.e.html) has translated the [Emergent Democracy Paper](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/EmergentDemocracyPaper) into Japanese and has been published it in their journal and is available online in [PDF](http://www.glocom.ac.jp/odp/library/75_02.pdf). I am a big fan of Professor Kumon and am honored that he has translated it himself.
