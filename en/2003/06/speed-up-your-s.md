I just read about "[Speed Up Your Site](http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/webmaster/20030425.html)" by Andrew B. King on [a klog apart](http://dijest.com/aka/) who links to [an entry](http://www.meryl.net/blog/) in meryl's notes. Sounds like a cool book. I think I saw some references to it in some email I got, but I thought it was spam. It's kinda scary how my brain has associated certain words with spam so it filters phrases such as "speed up your site". On the other hand, I'm glad that my RSS feed can help those catch those things that fall through my inbox.
