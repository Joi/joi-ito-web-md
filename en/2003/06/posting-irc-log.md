While I was asleep, a debate raged on the [IRC channel](irc://irc.freenode.net//#joiito) about whether IRC logs should be automatically turned into blog entries. kensanata pointed out that [VotingIsEvil](http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?VotingIsEvil) so I proposed a sort of deliberative democracy approach. Lets all have a discussion on [wiki page](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel) and post our positions on the issue. The point would be to change your mind freely and try to sway the opinions of others and recruit them. Like neuronal recruitment. I don't feel strongly about this issue and it appeared quite controversial. I thought it would be a good experiment in emergent democracy on wikis. That and the emergent democracy of [picking a party date.](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/PartyInDC030708) ;-)
