Larry's been proposing an idea called [The Eric Eldred Act](http://eldred.cc/) to require a $1 payment to extend copyright. This would cause most works which are out of print and currently unavailable to the public to fall into the public domain while at the same time protecting the copyright of people who are using copywritten work commercially. I think it's a great idea. [Larry reports](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/archives/2003_06.shtml#001315) that Congresswoman Lofgren (D-CA) and Congressman Doolittle (R-CA) have agreed to introduce the bill. That's great news.

*Thanks to [Victor](http://rvr.blogalia.com/) for the heads up on this...*
