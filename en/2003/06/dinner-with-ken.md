Had dinner tonight with [Ken Sakamura](http://joi.ito.com/moblog/archives/005555.html), the father of [TRON](http://www.tron.org/), the realtime embedded OS which is a dominant and essential part of most embedded systems in Japan today. He is also the Director of the Ubiquitous Networking Laboratory. He brought a bunch of amazing gadgets to dinner. The most impressive were the [0.2mm 128K RFID chips](http://joi.ito.com/moblog/archives/005556.html) in a little vial.
