Dave Sifry, whose opinion I greatly respect, has been trying to get to the bottom of this RSS controversy. He has talked to Dave Winer on the phone in length and it appears that the issue is really the use of the name, "RSS". Please read the [very interesting post](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000299.html#000299) (for those of you who care about RSS. ;-) ) by Sifry.
