I've just upgraded my [Technobot](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/TechnoBot). It is run every 10 minutes on my server and goes to [technorati](http://www.technorati.com), gets my cosomos, and does the following:

- Makes my technorati sidebar for my blog
- If there are new inbound links, it sends the link info to to the following places:

- My computer via email
- My cellphone via i-mode email (just normal email)
- To me via Jabber
- To the [#joiito channel on freenode](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel)

This is yet another step in the rather blasphemous experiment to connect all of the social software I can find together into one big blob. It's rather interesting watching people discover or rediscover new communication modes and the new meta-modes that the connections enable. For instance, I think that wikis and IRC seem to work well together since wikis are an easy way to log some of the interesting things in the rather transient conversations on IRC. Blogs are cool in IRC because it's a nice way to find out more about each other or to link to things one has said without quoting it in IRC.

Now I'm beginning to have the too-many-windows-to-focus-on-syndrome. Maybe I need another screen. ;-)

Thanks to [rvr](http://rvr.blogalia.com/) for helping me with the irc stuff...
