Philip Greenspun [blogs](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2003/06/21#a601) about the idea that stocks are going up in the US because more and more public domain is moving into the hands of large corporations. He gives the example of Disney being the beneficiary of the the copyright extension and the restriction on flying thru the airspace over Disneyland.
