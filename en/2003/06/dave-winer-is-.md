Dave [has written](http://backend.userland.com/2003/06/26#a313) that he is tentatively supporting [Echo](http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/RoadMap). Echo is the name of the initiative to try to put disagreements about blogging standards aside and try to move forward. This is great news.

Kudos, Dave!
