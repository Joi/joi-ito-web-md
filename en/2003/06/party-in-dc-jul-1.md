It looks like most people other than Dan Gillmor prefer to have the party on the 7th at the beginning [Supernova](http://www.pulver.com/supernova/). I'd like to start closing in on the details. If you plan to be in the DC Area and would like to attend the party, please go to the Wiki Page and put your name in the [wiki](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/PartyInDC030708) and vote on or suggest a venue if possible. You DO NOT have to be attending Supernova to attend this party.
