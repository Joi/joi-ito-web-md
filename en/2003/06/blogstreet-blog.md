Blog meta search has to figure out how to identify blog posts vs. web pages. Here's a [beta service](http://www.blogstreet.com/bpa.html) from Blogstreet.
> Blogs are different. They are made of blog-posts and not web-pages. So they have to be treated differently. The correct units when dealing with blogs are the blog-posts and their permalinks. Blog Post Analysis (BPA) is an attempt in building a platform for blog analytics by identifying and presenting the fundamental units of blogs, the blog-post.

Maybe Veer can sell it to Google so they can filter blog posts. ;-)
