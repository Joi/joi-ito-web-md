There is an anonymous parody of some of the "A-List" bloggers - ["Simple Guide to the A-List Bloggers"](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/blogparody.htm) on  [- on Scoble's site](http://scoble.weblogs.com/). I guess the "A-List" is defined as people worth wasting time writing a parody about. It's all very funny until you get to your part. ;-P

I'm going to link to this so it's not all laughing "behind my back."

*Thanks to the dozens of people who told me to go read this on IRC. ;-)*
