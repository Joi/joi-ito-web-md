![SO505i.jpg](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/SO505i.jpg)Just got my SO505i yesterday.

The good news first. It does flash. Hirata pointed out a [6K flash RSS reader](http://www.yasuhisa.com/is/fblogreader/) written by Yasuhisa which SHOULD work on my phone. This will be very cool. The 1.3 Megapixel camera works and feels like a real digital camera. The screen faces out so that you can use it like a camera without opening the phone.

The bad news. Emailing the 1280 x 960 images is impossible because of the size and because they phone doesn't let you even try making this silly mistake. It uses a new, yes a NEW memory stick format called [Memory Stick Duo](http://news.com.com/2100-1040-943456.html). I can't find it in stock anywhere and I need a NEW adapter for my Mac. Ugh.

The address book still sucks for English speakers because there is only one tab for english names in the address book.

Things that I MIGHT be able to get used to but are still weird: The antenna sticks out of your chin, the phone opens by twisting, not flipping, there is a little white LED that you can turn on and no flash. I can see how this might be more power efficient than a flash, but I haven't found it to be useful yet to light up subjects. Also, it's a bit big and heavy. It doesn't have GPS and location info so I'm sure I'll have [GPS envy](http://www.tokyotidbits.com/archives/000257.shtml).

Now I have to figure out how to thumbnail in python and add it to [my moblog](http://joi.ito.com/moblog/)...

UPDATE: I just found out that I can call and receive calls and talk without opening the phone. That's cool.
