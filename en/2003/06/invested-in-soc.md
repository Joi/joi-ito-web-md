Ross just [announced](http://www.socialtext.com/weblog/030623angel.html) an angel round raise for [Socialtext](http://www.socialtext.com/) which I participated in. Ross and his crew are working on wikis in the workplace and other social software solutions and represent the cutting edge on a variety fronts.
