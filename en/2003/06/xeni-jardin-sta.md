Xeni Jardin is one of those people about who you'd think, "Gee, I wish Xeni had a moblog." Well, now she has [one](http://xenijardin.textamerica.com/). She just started, but it's cool. She's inspiring me to increase my caption space and be a bit more funny and thoughtful on my annotations. She's going to push us all to be more interesting in our moblogs. ;-)
