I spent the morning on IRC instead of reading my RSS feeds and thinking of something to blog. The most interesting thing that happened today was Eric Haller, who was a 2nd AD on Indian Runner dropped into IRC. Eric and I probably worked harder than many of the people on the movie. If I remember correctly, it was Eric's job to make the call sheets and put sheets under people's doors every night or something. I just remember working late and seeing him around a lot with a bunch of papers. I haven't seen him since 1991 or whenever it was that I was in Omaha working on [Indian Runner](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0102116). The movie was directed by Sean Penn. The executive producer, Thom Mount raised the money for the film from NHK the Japanese broadcast company. He hired me to work for him so that I could manage the relationship with the Japanese investors (keep them off his back) in exchange for "teaching me the rope." This basically meant that I got no sleep and had to do everything from ordering helicoptors taking care of the carpets for Thom's apartment. I was "Associate to Mr. Mount" in the credits. I show up in a tiny font at the end of the movie and can be seen for the first time at home now that I have a big display and Indian Runner is out on DVD.

The interesting thing about movies is that people get together for a few months and work intensely. Then it's a wrap and everyone's off doing other things. It's like a compressed year in school together. I've kept in touch with many people that I worked with on Indian Runner. Thom's over at RKO, Mark Bisgeier has an entertainment law practice, Eric's got a [blog](http://erichaller.com/) and an art gallery, Jay Koiwai just sent me email. Hmm... Maybe I should make a movie crew reunion site. ;-p

Another random Indian Runnerism is that John Valenti, Jack Valenti's son, worked with me briefly. John is a cool guy who I kept in touch with for awhile, but have lost touch with recently. I wonder what John thinks of his father's position on DMCA...
