Sounds like a party wants to happen in DC on July 7th. A bunch of us will be there for [Supernova](http://www.pulver.com/supernova/). I have set up a [wiki page](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/PartyInDC030708) to plan the party. Looking for suggestions for places and volunteers to help organize it. Please post on the wiki.

Update: There is a conflict with another dinner. Moved it to the 7th.
