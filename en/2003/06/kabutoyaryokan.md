[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/kabutoya-thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/kabutoya.html)Mizuka and I just got back from [Kabutoya-ryokan](http://www2n.biglobe.ne.jp/~kabutoya/english.html). It's a very old building 18 generations old. It used to be a silk-worm/silk facility, but now it's an inn. Very old fashioned rooms. Traditional *irori* typed grill in your room. (See pictures on my [moblog](http://joi.ito.com/moblog/).) This morning they made *mochi*, a kind of Japanese pounded rice. I took some video that didn't turn out that great, but it's available [here](rtsp://stream.joi.ito.com/mochi.mov) as a Quicktime Video Stream.
