Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn has just gone through and responded to many of the points raised in the [LinkedIn wiki page](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/LinkedIn). If you had posted comments and were waiting for him to respond, please go check out his comments. He has interspersed his comments in dialog in wiki style. Thanks to the people who posted comments and thanks to Reid for all of the thoughtful responses. Now my wiki is much smarter. ;-)
