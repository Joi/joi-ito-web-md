Adriaan, who [I lunched with](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/24/lunch_with_adriaan_developer_of_kunglog.html) awhile ago, is the developer of [Kung-Log](http://www.kung-foo.tv/kunglog.php), which is the client I use to post to MT. He [writes about](http://www.kung-foo.tv/blog/archives/000491.php#000491) his thoughts on the [MetaWeblog API](http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi). He is a good example of someone who actually has to use all of the API's to try to allow his users to post to the variety of weblogs. We REALLY should try to keep the API consistant so that people like Adriaan can continue to write tools for blogs. As the blog software folks start their feature race, the trick will be for the API to keep up with everything. I think the API is great because unlike unweildy standards like bluetooth that tries to design in every single possibility from the beginning, the MetaWeblog API has evolved and stayed simple. I guess the question is, can the current process keep up with the increasing diversity and feature race? Any thoughts [Dave](http:///www.scripting.com/)?

Here's Adriaan's suggestion.

> What is my suggestion? Use the MetaWeblog API, BUT complement it with the MovableType methods, and possibly any new Blogger2 API features.
