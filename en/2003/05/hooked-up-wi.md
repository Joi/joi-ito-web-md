[![](http://joi.ito.com/images/joijim-tm.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/images/joijim.jpg)Hooked up with [Jim Moore](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/jim/) at FiRe. He shares an office at Harvard with [Dave Winer](http://www.scripting.com/). The last time I saw Jim was at the [Fortune conference in Aspen](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/08/01/fortune_brainstorm_2002_wrap_up.html) last year and it was nice to see him again and catch up. We talked aboout the debate about googlewashing that his [Second Superpower paper](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/jmoore/secondsuperpower.html) triggered.

[Jim](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/jim/2003/05/19#a187), [Dave Winer](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/05/17#When:9:03:59PM"), [Doc Searls](http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/05/18#moreOnPrintwash) blog about the current discussion which includes recent comments by the New York Times.

We talked about [Emergent Democracy](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/EmergentDemocracy) and some of the problems with my current paper. He agreed to try to comment/edit it on my Wiki. People have made a lot of great comments on the Wiki and it's getting really interesting, but as far as I know, no one has edited the actual paper directly yet. It will be interesting to see who does it first. It's currently signed, "Mostly by Joichi Ito" but if enough people edit it directly, I will change it to something like "Hosted by Joichi Ito" or something like that.
