[![elliot_thumb.jpg](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/elliot_thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/elliot.html)I met Elliot Noss, the man behind [Tucows](http://www.tucows.com/). I've been a huge fan of Tucows ever since Thomas Riha showed it to me during an [Ars Electronica](http://www.aec.at/en/index.asp) Jury meeting. I've watched it grow and was always interested in who ran it. [Doc Searls](http://doc.weblogs.com/) met (update: [Doc knows him from '98 or so](http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/05/23)) Elliot at [ETcon](http://conferences.oreilly.com/etcon2002/) and told me I should meet him. It was a nice suprise to run into Elliot at FiRe. Elliot's in the domain name game and we talked about ICANN and other stuff. We agreed on just about everything and I was happy to find out that Elliot was just as cool as Tucows. Elliot and his wife had just gotten back from Shanghai and he joined our China/Japan session. We had dinner with Sidney Rittenberg and talked about China. I guess the domain name business takes you all over the world and Elliot seems like the right kind of guy to run a global business.

Sidney, is another amazing guy that I enjoyed meeting very much. he has a very interesting bio.
> excerpt from FiRe bio
>
> He became a leading translator for the works of Mao Zedong, and was the only American citizen accepted into the Chinese Communist Party, until the Cultural Revolution.   
> [...]  
> Sixteen of Sidney's 35 years in China were spent as a prisoner in solitary confinement on charges of being an American spy. He was freed in 1977 and declared a true friend of China. His family became a myth and a legend, giving them easy entrée to China's leaders -- a great advantage for their consulting work.

Sidney was a co-host with me on the China/Japan Panel. He was extremely energetic, informed and sharp and knew more about China than anyone I have ever met in my life.

*The title is not completely accurate. It was a buffet dinner and I had part of my dinner with Elliot and Sidney.*
