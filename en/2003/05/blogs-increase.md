[Jon Udell has got a keen eye for biological metaphors for information systems, and here comes up with a nice one](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/04/29.html) for how weblogs change the shape of organizations:
> Think of an organization as a single-celled animal. Blogs increase the surface area of the cell, help nutrients flow across its membrane, and promote multicellular cooperation.

*I'm on the road with low bandwidth and was spending too much time commenting on my blog to think of something original to blog today.
