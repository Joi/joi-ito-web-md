Finally got a chance to talk to Dan about his new book and the future of journalism over lunch. We talked about what journalism really was. My thought was that journalism is defined in the constitution and is a part of democracy. Dan's notion is that the Net and blogging is changing the nature of journalism which in turn has a huge impact on society and democracy. This huge impact is one of the missing parts of my/our [emergent democracy paper](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/EmergentDemocracyPaper). Dan's going to focus on journalism, but obviously recognizes the connection with democracy.

We tried to deconstruct what traditional media was. My thought was that the founding father defined "the press" as individuals and small groups with printing presses to represent the voice of the people and that currently, newspapers are just printing machine owners and paper distributors just like telephone companies are a bunch of telephone poles and pipes. Dan asserted that there was more to it. He explained that the protection from lawsuits is an very real risk to journalists and that media companies protect their journalist from such suits. I can see that. Relates to [the discussion about the Creative Commons license](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/05/14/defending_creative_commons.html).

We talked about reputation a lot and about [technorati](http://www.technorati.com). Nob Seki, follows up the discussion on [his blog](http://www.syncworld.net/blog/nob/archives/000623.html#000623) and discusses the notion of Trusted TrackBacks and the relationship between the interviewer and interviewee.
