[![](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/spotme-thumb.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/spotme.html)They have this [Spotme](http://www.spotme.info/) device at this conference which has a very cool feature. You can see the names of the other participants who are near you and approximately how many meters they are away from you. You can also exchange business cards with people which get emailed to you.

Similar to the Japanese [Lovegety](http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/Bunker/5921/lovegety.html) but a bit more serious focus. ;-)
