Dan Gillmor came over to my house yesterday and we were going to talk about the book he was writing, "[Making the News](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000924.shtml#000924)". He asked me whether I had read the outline... no... Oops. Sorry! We ended up making another appointment and spent the rest of the time geeking out. Anyway, that's not the point I want to make.

I felt really guilty, and came up with a great idea. I opened my mac in my car and got it to start reading the outline to me using text to speech. This is the first time I really tried it and it worked well. (Although the woman's voice reading Dan's words was a bit weird.) So then I thought about this some more. What I really want is a text to speech to mp3 converter that took my RSS feed and dumped it into an mp3 file that I could listen to my iPod on the way to work.

The other thing I could do is make my blog available in mp3 format. Has someone already done this? Is there a text to mp3 tool somehwere? Is this a stupid idea?

Update: Dan just [blogged](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001009.shtml#001009) about yesterday. He writes about our geeking out. What we did was get ssh and port-forwarding running on his Mac. I totally don't understand why more people don't use ssh port-forwarding for mail and sftp and scp for file transfers. Welcome to the society of ssh lovers Dan. ;-)
