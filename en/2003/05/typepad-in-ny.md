Nice [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/08/technology/circuits/08blog.html) in the New York Times about TypePad. As usual, you need to log into the NYT site. (At least it's back.) As you know, Neoteny, my company, is an investor in Six Apart which is making TypePad. TypePad is a hosted blogging service which is launching real soon now. ;-)

The article explains that people will have to pay to use the service. (Yes, we ARE going to try to make money.) It also says that it will have a lot of cool features including a photo album feature and moblogging, built in.
