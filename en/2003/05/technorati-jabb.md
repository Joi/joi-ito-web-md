OK I figured out my next python project. A bot that polls technorati for inbound links to my blog and sends them to me as they come in via IM (Jabber). This is probably going to challenge my programming skills, especially since I know nothing about Jabber... yet. So, if someone is already working on this or has already done this. Stop me now!

Also, if you know of any relevant python modules I should look at, that would be greatly appreciated. I plan to try out Mark Pilgrim's PyTechnorati.
