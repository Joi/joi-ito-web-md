This entry is about the NTT DoCoMo FOMA P2401 and PowerBooks and TOTALLY irrelevant for most people. Sorry.

The NTT DoCoMo FOMA P2401 is a G3 384K bps PCMCIA data card. It's ridiculously expensive since you have to pay by the packet, but it's really fast. It didn't work on the Mac. For some reason, after you used it for awhile, the IP connection stopped working even though you were still connected. I couldn't find anything on the web about it and wrote a lot of bug report mail to Apple, but nothing happened. My guess is it was a problem with PC Card support at that speed. Anyway, it works now with the 10.2.6 OS X upgrade. Having said that, I used it today on the way to the office and the throughput was a bit choppy. I don't know if it was the coverage or the software...

So, if you had bought a FOMA P2401 and were anxiously awaiting proper support on OS X, you're in luck.
