I had a long talk yesterday with Reid Hoffman about LinkedIn giving him my feedback and thoughts about features and changes. Reid's very open to ideas and is working on improving LinkedIn. I suggested we take the discussion to a wiki so that we can keep track of things like feature requests and links to posts about LinkedIn. I've set up a [wiki page](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/LinkedIn) on my wiki. Please take a look and add your feedback, links, or feature requests.
