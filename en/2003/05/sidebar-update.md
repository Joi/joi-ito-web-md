I added a new style sheet and a new style sheet class. On my sidebar, if you click on humble style, it will set your style sheet to a style sheet based on the polite fonts style sheet (big fonts) where I've added a new class called "boastful". This style sheet will render text that I think might seem boastful in a tiny white font so you don't see them. (I couldn't figure out a way to delete them all together in css.) So if you want to stop seeing my boastful disclaimers and generally cut down on boastful comments altogether, change your stylesheet please.

Also, I ripped off an idea I saw on [Liz's site](http://www.it.rit.edu/~ell/mamamusings/) and made my archives in my sidebar pulldown forms.
