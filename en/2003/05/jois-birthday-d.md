In an attempt to learn python, organize my life and figure out how to mess with Chandler some more, I have decided to make a database of birthdays of my friends. If you consider yourself my friend, please go to the [birthday entry form](http://joi.ito.com/bday.html) and enter your info. Thanks in advance!
