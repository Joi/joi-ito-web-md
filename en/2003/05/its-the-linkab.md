[Doc just blogged](http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/05/17#maybeItsAboutTheRatioOfLinkableToUnlinkablePages) about a thought I just had too. If the big print media put their archives online and made them crawlable and linkable, I bet their page rankings would go up. It's really the links between the archives of the blogs that gives blogs so many links. The solution to googlewashing is probably more about getting other forms of journalism published in a more link-friendly way than filtering the blogs.
