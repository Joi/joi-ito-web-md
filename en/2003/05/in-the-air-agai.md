Traveling again from today. I'm making a VERY short trip to SF on my way to San Diego to attend Future in Review. Then I'm going to St. Gallen Switzerland to give a talk about [Emergent Democracy](http://joi.ito.com/EmergentDemocracy) at the ISC Symposium and will be back in Tokyo on Monday the 26th...

My trip to SF is very short so I won't be able to have a party this time. Sorry! Next trip, I'll have another party. I'm meeting a few people, but definitely don't have time this trip to meet all of the people I want to see. Apologies in advance to people who I won't see this trip. (At least to those people who want to see me who I won't be able to see...) FYI, my schedule is completely booked.
