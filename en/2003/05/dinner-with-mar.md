![markoffdvorakdin.jpg](http://joi.ito.com/archives/images/markoffdvorakdin.jpg)Had dinner, talked about blogging and had more dinner tonight with [John Dvorak](http://www.dvorak.org/) of [PC Magazine](http://www.pcmag.com/category2/0,4148,3574,00.asp) and John Markoff from the New York Times. Markoff and Dvorak are about as different as they come, but are good friends and make a really funny pair to have dinner with.

Dvorak said he wanted to start a blog. Both John & John are anti-bloggers, but I agreed that Dvorak would be much more convincing if he was critical after having blogged. We talked about [Andrew Orlowski](http://www.yarbles.demon.co.uk/) and the attention he has been giving my blog these days. We discussed the importance of lunches and dinners in the journalistic process and discussed Andrew's journalism. One amazing thing about Dvorak is that he can be talking about the food, wine, the owner of the restaurant, Orlowski's writing style and Apple Computer all at the same time. Sometimes I got confused about whether Dvorak was talking about Orlowski's writing or the food. I think Dvorak would make a good blogger.

We talked about googlewashing and I agreed to link to [Dvorak's](http://www.dvorak.org) site often to help increase his google page ranking. ;-) We talked a lot about the importance of thick skin and a sense of humor.

Update: [Andrew Orlowski's current web page](http://www.badpress.net/). I linked to the old one because that's what came up first on Google. Sorry. Noticed that [Dvorak](http://www.dvorak.org) was on Andrew's list of "[Stuff I like](http://www.badpress.net/ilike.html)"
