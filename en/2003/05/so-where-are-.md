I've been tuned out of the warblogging these days, but I have a question for the warbloggers. Did they find any WMD? Because... if they didn't I've lost a great deal of respect for Colin Powell. It was his passionate argument about how he was convinced beyond doubt that Iraq had WMD that moved me to [say](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/01/26/colin_powell_in_davos.html) I was "more supportive" of the US.
