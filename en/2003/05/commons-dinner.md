Had dinner with Brewster and Mary, Larry, Bettina and Glenn at the [Foreign Cinema](http://www.foreigncinema.com/). First time at the Foreign Cinema. Cool place with good food. Nice open feeling, loved the wide selection of oysters. Also, both dinners so far this trip were organized using [OpenTable.com](http://OpenTable.com) which I saw for this first time.

Brewster arrived with a box full of very old software. He had just finished testifying about why DMCA was preventing him from breaking copy protection on old software that he wanted to [archive](http://www.archive.org/). The DMCA affects our lives in lots of ways and we need more people like Brewster to point out the stupidity of such laws trying to prevent legitimate activities for the sake of protecting the position of a few big media companies. What's scary for me is that Japan is trying to put together their own DMCA in a "me too" kind of stupid way. The problem is, we don't have people like Larry and Brewster in Japan and I can only image how much work it's going to be to fight it there.

Met Glenn, the Executive Director of the [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org) for the first time today. Enjoyed our conversation very much. He was supportive of [my position on the guarantee issue](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/05/14/defending_creative_commons.html) with regards to the CC license. (I guess he should be.) He told me that [Glocom](http://www.glocom.ac.jp/top/index.e.html), where I recently [gave a talk on Emergent Democracy](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/05/15/talk_at_glocom_about_emergent_democracy.html), was working on localizing Creative Commons for Japan. That's GREAT! I was worried that the Japanese would end up continuing to with that ["Free use label" for webcontent](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/02/05/japanese_version_of_creative_commons.html) stuff that the Ministry of Culture was doing.

Talked about the idea of using the Creative Commons Conservancy in the standardization process where it might act as a repository for assets like domain names. I had talked about this with Robert Kaye and [Musicbrainz](http://www.musicbrainz.org/). I'll write another entry about this idea after I flesh it out a bit more, but I'm pretty excited about it.

Talked a lot about how smart [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/) was.

*I wish my jet lag would go away so my brain cells didn't start to check out at the end of these dinners. Maybe I should stop drinking when I travel. Hmm...*

One more thing: We talked about Larry's [push to get a bill passed](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/archives/2003_05.shtml#001187) to have a $1 fee to keep a copyright 50 years after publication. This put put A LOT of stuff into the public domain and is very hard to argue against and seems extremely practical... you would think. Well, it's harder than it looks. He needs our help.
