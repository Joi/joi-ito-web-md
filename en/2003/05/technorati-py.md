I finished my script today. If you look at my sidebar, you will find a list of blogs that [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/) says have linked to me in order of freshness. I wrote it in python using the xml.dom module. Once I got my head around it, it all made sense and was very easy. Thanks again to [Dive Into Python](http://diveintopython.org/). Other than the fact that you should all be very impressed by my programming skill, I think Technorati inbound links is probably the most timely and comprehensive way to see who is linking to you.

My biggest problem with trackbacks right now is that since my site is heavy, trackbacks time out and people end up sending lots of them thinking they didn't go through. Also, since people can put just about anything in the trackbacks, I end up with long worded URL's in my trackback pings which screw up with width of my sidebar.

So, trackbacks will now be listed at with each entry and Technorati will be take the position in my sidebar.

Now I have to bug David Sifry about trying to identify the permalinks better and filtering out the false positives...
