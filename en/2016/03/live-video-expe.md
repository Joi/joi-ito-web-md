On Sunday, I tried convening a conversation with Media Lab students and researchers to have an open conversation where we [streamed it live on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/joiito/videos/963747470377855/) and YouTube. We ended up talking a lot about communications, ideas and patents. I got mostly positive feedback so I think we'll do it again. Any thoughts on how to improve the format would be greatly appreciated.

Better audio and video is on the list.
