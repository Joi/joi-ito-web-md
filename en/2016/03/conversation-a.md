Conversation at the MIT Media Lab about cybernetics with Paul Pangaro, Nathan Felde, Mike Bove, Iyad Rahwan, Edith Ackermann, Joi Ito and Lorrie LeJeune. A few background posts: <http://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/designandscience> / <http://www.dubberly.com/articles/cybernetics-and-counterculture.html> - March 17, 2016 - noon - 1:30PM Eastern Time

[We posted it live on Facebook using FB Mentions and the archive of the video and the chat are up there now.](https://www.facebook.com/joiito/videos/961545600598042/)

As an experiment, I also uploaded to YouTube and embedded it below. If you have the energy, please try both and tell me which you like better.

More broadly, this is an experiment in video but also in "fly on the way" streaming. Please let me know if you find this interesting. Trying to decide whether to do more of it and whether to do it on FB, YouTube, Periscope or some other platform.

Also, other than a better lens and a better mic, what can I do to improve it?
