It looks like I can [post to Medium from my blog using RSS](https://medium.com/@saul/creating-medium-stories-via-rss-c2ac93d08288#.o0rd4xikj) by using [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/). [I'm going to give this a try](https://medium.com/@joi/posting-to-medium-from-my-blog-3d7a7367398f).

I like having my blog as the primary source and archive and am excited by different ways that we can then distribute/syndicate the content out.
