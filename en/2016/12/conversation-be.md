A few days ago, I did a Facebook Live Q&A about our book with my co-author Jeff Howe and our fabulous researcher who helped us with the book, Chia Evers. We talked about what it was like to work on the book together and answered some questions including what we learned that was the most surprising.

It was a fun conversation. Here's a YouTube video of it.

The audio of the conversation is also on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/facebook-live-q-about-whiplash/id1149206722?i=1000378723596&mt=2) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/joi-ito/facebook-live-q-a-about).
