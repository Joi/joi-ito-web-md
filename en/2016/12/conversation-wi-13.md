Talking to Media Lab faculty member, Kevin Esvelt who runs the Sculpting Evolution group about his work in developing safe and ethical ways to deploy technologies like CRISPR gene drive. He is currently working in Nantucket with communities there to have a conversation about how to move research and deployment forward to try to eradicate Lyme disease.

We talk about his work and how it connects with [Whiplash](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/joi-ito/whiplash/9781455544585/).
