I recently had a Facebook Live conversation with Shaka Senghor, a Media Lab Director's Fellow and author. Shaka spent 19 years in prison for second-degree murder. In prison Shaka found a path to redemption initially through reading and then writing. I met him just after he had come out of prison. You can read more about this in the [foreword to his book that I wrote](https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2013/02/07/my-foreword-to.html).

Shaka's an amazing leader, writer, inspiration and an important voice behind the fight against the systematic mass incarceration in the US.

We talk about prison, his book, [Writing My Wrongs](http://www.writingmywrongsbook.com/) and a bit about [Whiplash](https://whiplashbook.com/).

Audio of the conversation is available on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/conversation-shaka-senghor/id1149206722?i=1000379302638&mt=2) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/joi-ito/conversation-with-shaka).
