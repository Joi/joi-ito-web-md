I had my [third podcast conversation with Michael Harren for his podcast Mikeypod](http://mikeypod.com/2016/12/19/mikeypod-221-mit-media-lab-director-author-joi-ito/) and streamed it on Facebook while recording it for my own podcast ([iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/conversation-michael-harren/id1149206722?i=1000379064760&mt=2)/[Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/joi-ito/conversation-with-michael)). My first podcast co-production!

(I sometimes call him Mikey because of his podcast name, but I think I'm supposed to call him Michael.) Michael is an activist, vegan and loves animals. We've inspired each other over the years and it was great to catch up with him after he read Whiplash. We talked about podcasting, veganism and lots of other stuff.
