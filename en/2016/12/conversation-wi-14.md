I've known Kathy for years from when I was an entrepreneur in Japan and later when I was a "business executive" and a member of things like *Keizai Doyukai* (Japanese Association of Corporate Executives). We were sometimes on panels together and would run into each other a lot at various meetings. Kathy, as the Chief Japan strategist for Goldman Sachs would often be about the important trends that were affecting Japan.

I caught up with her recently to learn about women's role in Japanese business, business culture and a bit about Kathy's background and path.
