[LibrePlanet 2016](https://libreplanet.org/2016/) and the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/) happened to be having meetings at MIT at the same time so Harry Halpin from the W3C thought that it would be a great opportunity to have a public discussion about Digital Restrictions Management\* [(DRM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management). The W3C was having a discussion about DRM and the World Wide Web and considering [Encrypted Media Extensions (EME)](https://www.w3.org/blog/2016/04/html-media-extensions-to-continue-work/) which would build DRM support into the Web standards and various parties were trying argue against it. They didn't have room over at CSAIL so he approached me about having it at the Media Lab and I agree to host it as long as it was clear that this didn't didn't signal some official position by the the Lab.

We were able to pull together an interesting panel with Richard Stallman from the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/), Danny O'Brien from the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) and Harry Halpin from the World Wide Web Consortium as the moderator. Harry and I were speaking on behalf of ourselves and not our (in my case various) organizations and affiliations.

As you might imagine with this group, it wasn't a debate, but arguments against DRM from a various perspectives and levels of intensity. :-)

Here's the blurb from Harry.

> Will the future of the Web include Digital Rights Management? The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the MIT-based international standards body in charge of "bringing the Web to its full potential" is in process of deciding if they should continue their work on Encrypted Media Extensions (EME). The recommendation of EME by W3C would standardize the use of Digital Rights Management (DRM) across browsers. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) has petitioned W3C to stop all work on EME and DRM-related technologies. The W3C will consider adopting a DRM non-aggression covenant drafted by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) at its Advisory Committee meeting at MIT next week.

> This is an open invitation for genuine person-to-person dialogue with people from MIT, FSF, EFF, and W3C about DRM on the Web (and any other topics of importance to the Web).

\* Richard Stallman insists we call it Digital Restrictions Management although industry more commonly refers to it as "Digital Rights Management."

I wrote a bit about DRM in my PubPub post, "[Why anti-money laundering laws and poorly designed copyright laws are similar and should be revised](http://pubpub.ito.com/pub/dmca-drm-aml-kyc-backdoors)."
