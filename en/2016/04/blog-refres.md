Our website circa 1996

  
Thanks to [Boris Anthony](http://borisanthony.net/) and [Daiji Hirata](http://daijihirata.com/) for helping to upgrade and clean up my blog.

We upgraded the platform to [Movable Type Pro 6.2.4](https://movabletype.com/). (Yes, I still use Movable Type!) [Daiji and Boris got Facebook Instant Articles](http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2016/04/05/testing-faceboo.html) working [inspired by Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/02/26/1068.html) and with the help from folks over at Facebook. (Thanks!) Boris cleaned up the design of the blog and also made it responsive - much more mobile friendly.

What's amazing to me is how well the design has held up over the years.

[We (the founding team of Eccosys) set up our web server in 1993](http://www.japaninc.com/cpj/magazine/issues/1995/nov95/11eccosys.html). I have a feeling this thing dated July 1, 1993 is the first journal-like thing I posted on the Internet: ["Howard Mentioned me in Wired!"](http://joi.ito.com/weblog/1993/07/01/howard-mentione.html) In 2002, with [Justin Hall](http://www.links.net/)'s help, [I converted my static website to a "blog."](http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2002/06/27/site-soft-launc.html) I had a journal on my static website, but this new "blogging" thing made updating much easier.

Boris took over my blog design in the summer of 2003 and [we relaunched the site in July of 2003](http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2003/07/26/a-new-look-for.html). In 2008, we did [a major redesign](http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2008/05/20/my-new-look-and.html) including a shiny new logo from [Susan Kare](http://kare.com/).

It is quite amazing to me that with all of the various changes in technology, that most of the content on my website has been able to migrate through all of these upgrades. I'm also happy that Archive.org keeps [archives of this site with its original designs](http://web.archive.org/web/*/joi.ito.com) and [eccosys.com which preceded it](http://web.archive.org/web/*/eccosys.com), although the very first versions from 1993 are lost as far as I know. The web and its standards are very robust and I hope they stay that way.
