Sitting at home and looking out the window was a bit other-worldly. A snowy day in April is rare even in Boston. I seem to have gotten myself sick again. (After being mostly immune to everything for years, I've had a series of colds and flues this year. More on my theories about this in another post.)

For the last few days, [Boris](http://borisanthony.net/ "Boris Anthony"), [Daiji](http://daijihirata.com/) and I have been following in the [footsteps of Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/02/26/1068.html) and have been trying to get my RSS feed from my [Movable Type Blog](https://movabletype.org/ "Snow in April") to become compatible with [Facebook Instant Articles](https://instantarticles.fb.com/ "Snow in April") so that it would be approved. We have been going back and forth with the Facebook team who have been friendly and responsive. I THINK we finally have it working.

So here we go. If you read this on Facebook on the app, you should see the thunderbolt mark and it should load really easily.

Thanks to Dave for getting me going on this thread and to Boris, Daiji and the folks at Facebook who helped out. My Open Web feels a bit more loved tonight than it did before.
