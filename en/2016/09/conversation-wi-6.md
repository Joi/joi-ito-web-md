Seth Godin has taught me so much about communications, leadership, publishing and life that I thought that it was important to stream my conversation with Seth. As usual, it was a great conversation.

Seth is on the [Media Lab Advisory Council](http://www.media.mit.edu/people/advisory).

I streamed it to [Facebook Live](https://www.facebook.com/joiito/videos/1084294184989849/) and posted the video to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNUqLfEj0Ow) and audio to [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/joi-ito/a-conversation-with-seth-godin) and [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/conversation-with-seth-godin/id1149206722?i=1000375184520&mt=2).
