Martin Nowak runs the [Program for Evolutionary Dynamics](http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard. At a recent meeting at his Lab, I heard him describe the history of life on earth in fascinating way using evolutionary dynamics. At another meeting over dinner, Danny Hillis and he disagreed on whether you could model the universe on a Turing machine - in other words, can we simulate our "run" our brains or the universe digitally.

I decided to ask Martin over to my house to see if I could extract these two stories. I streamed the [conversation on Facebook Live](https://www.facebook.com/joiito/videos/1070073449745256/) and tried to clean it up a bit and [posted it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiNdCTSTcRU).
