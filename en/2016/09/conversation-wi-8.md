This year, the [Shuttleworth Foundation asked me to be the honorary steward of the September 2016 fellowship intake](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/thinking/2016/03/17/thinking-Steward-Joi-Ito/). This meant that I would help review and recommend the people who would receive the [Shuttleworth Fellowship](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/fellows/) which funds the fellow's salary as well as their project up to $250,000. It's one of the most interesting and successful fellowship programs that I know for funding unique, provocative and unconventional individuals and their ideas. I'm a huge fan.

We saw some great applications and I was really happy with the three fellows selected for the round that I worked on, [Achal, Isha and Ugo](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/thinking/2016/07/13/thinking-welcome-achal-isha-ugo/). Through the process I got to know their work quite well and I was excited to get a chance to meet Isha when I was in New York last week.

Isha Datar works on cellular agriculture research, the science of growing animal projects in cell cultures instead of farmed herds. It's a very new field with a lot of challenges including questions about how to make non-animal based nutrient systems, how to make it taste good, how to make it energy efficient, how to scale it, etc. At her non-profit organization [New Harvest](http://www.new-harvest.org/), Isha is working on the core research as well as funding and coordinating research across the world. What's exciting and important to me is that she's decided to do this in an open source and collaborative non-profit way because she and her colleagues believe that the field is still very early and that it would be advanced most effectively through this non-profit structure.
