I recently visited and had a conversation with Limor "Lady Ada" Fried and Phil Torrone of [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/). I first met them about ten years ago at SxSW.

Limor is an MIT grad that we're super-proud of and Phil is an amazing pioneer in communications, hacking and many other things. Phil and Limor are two of my most favorite people and I aways get giddy just getting a chance to hang out with them. We discussed making, electronics, business, manufacturing, hacking, live video and more.

They've been doing live video daily for the last 10 years or so and are real pioneers in this medium as well. We used their setup to stream the video to Facebook Live and Periscope and posted the recordings on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXtLjb3ZOFs) and the audio on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/joi-ito/conversation-with-adafruit) and [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/conversation-with-adafruit/id1149206722?i=1000375184519&mt=2).
