[Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_S._Langer) is the most cited engineer in the history of the world. He is an [MIT Institute Professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Institute_Professors_at_the_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology) (there are usually only 12). He is also (lucky for me), a friend and a great mentor of mine since [I met him in 2013 at my first Red Sox](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151725311116998&l=3601072d7b) game with [David Lucchino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-l-lucchino-0490421) who introduced us and invited us to the game.

Bob is a great example and mentor for so many people. I recently got a chance to catch up with him and hear about his story and talk about things like peer review and the future of science. I streamed it using my Mevo to [Facebook Live](https://www.facebook.com/joiito/videos/1079042045515063/) and then posted a cleaner video to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vddQ0hxvTk0) and audio to [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/joi-ito/bob-langer-and-joi-ito) and [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/interviewing-bob-langer/id1149206722?i=1000374970843&mt=2).
