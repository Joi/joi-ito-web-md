[Neha Narula](http://nehanarula.org/) wrote a [post on Medium](https://medium.com/mit-media-lab-digital-currency-initiative/whats-new-at-mit-s-digital-currency-initiative-9d53c39502d3#.r7r76g9vo) last Monday about the [MIT Digital Currency Initiative at the Media Lab](http://dci.mit.edu/) (DCI) and her new role as the Research Director. Also on Monday, [TED posted her talk on the future of money](http://www.ted.com/talks/neha_narula_the_future_of_money), which I think is one of clearest "what is Bitcoin" explanations I've seen. I saw her a few days later and did a Facebook Live conversation with her which I've uploaded to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9oZL4oh_3w), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/joi-ito/conversation-with-neha-narula) and [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/conversation-neha-narula/id1149206722?i=1000375361360&mt=2).

Neha has been working as a member of the DCI for awhile now, but in this new role, she will drive the technical research agenda of the DCI and help coordinate research inside of MIT as well as in other academic institutions and in the broader community. She comes with a solid technical background with [a PhD from MIT in distributed systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~neha/) and previously as a software engineer at Google. Neha and the DCI have already been actively engaged in research, development and teaching in digital currencies, blockchain and related fields, but with Neha's leadership, I'm hoping that we can continue to ramp these efforts up as well as increase collaboration and engagement.

Neha lead the creation of [a website for the DCI](http://dci.mit.edu/index.html) where you can learn about some of the projects and people involved. Also, as I wrote in [a Medium post on September 6](https://medium.com/mit-media-lab-digital-currency-initiative/dci-update-5bcda9255e8#.vuktfnp7t), Brian Forde, the director of the DCI will be transitioning out of that role.
