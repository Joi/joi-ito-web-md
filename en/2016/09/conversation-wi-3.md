Sultan is the most interesting person I know in the United Arab Emirates. I met him in 2010 or so, soon after I had moved to Dubai. He had just been asked to "take a break" from his job as a journalist at The National, the main national newspaper, for being controversial. I helped him get started on Twitter and he taught me about the culture and politics of region.

He is now a [Director's Fellow at the Media Lab](http://directorsfellows.media.mit.edu/) and a good friend and advisor.

I recently had the opportunity to catch up with him and get an update and some overviews about the region - Arab Spring, arts, politics, media, culture.

I streamed it with my Mevo to [Facebook Live](https://www.facebook.com/joiito/videos/1074921725927095/) and have posted a better quality [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzAfuT7a0YU) and the audio on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/joi-ito/sultan-al-qassemi-and-joi-ito-conversation) and [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/sultan-al-qassemi-joi-ito/id1149206722?i=1000374888962&mt=2).
