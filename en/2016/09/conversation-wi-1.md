Daiko Matsuyama is the Deputy Head Priest of the [Taizoin Zen Buddhist Temple](http://www.taizoin.com/en/). Tenzin Priyadarshi is the president and CEO of the [Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values](http://thecenter.mit.edu/) at MIT and Director of the Ethics Initiative at the MIT Media Lab.

The three of us are all friends but had never had met together so we decided to try a 3-way Skype streamed on Facebook Live to talk about Daiko's new book he was asking me to blurb. Unfortunately, the book is only in Japanese so far.

We talked about meditation, Zen, the mindfulness movement and Buddhism. The original [discussion was on Facebook Live](https://www.facebook.com/joiito/videos/1070662889686312/), but I tried to clean it up and [posted that on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSfBbRNSIRQ).
