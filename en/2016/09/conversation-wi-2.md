I learned about [Julia Reda](https://juliareda.eu/en/) reading [Kaz Taira's blog post](http://wp.me/p2K5bJ-1Mv) about her visit to Japan for a [Movements for Internet Active Users (MIAU)](https://miau.jp/) meeting.

Julia Reda is a Member of the European Parliament representing Germany, and she also serves as a Vice-President of the Greens/EFA group, president of the Young Pirates of Europe and a member of the Pirate Party of Germany.

She is was the rapporteur of the Parliament's review of 2001's Copyright Directive.

We set a Skype call and some of the EU's secret conversations about copyright leaked just as the call was starting so we used this as an opportunity to talk about some of the crazy copyright laws being proposed and passed in Europe right now.

I [streamed the video on Facebook Live](https://www.facebook.com/joiito/videos/1073982682687666/) and [posted a cleaner version on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGLpGGFtRg).
