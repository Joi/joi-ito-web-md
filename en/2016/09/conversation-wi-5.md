[Danny Hillis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Hillis) is the inventor of the Connection Machine, Co-Founder of the Long Now Foundation and visiting professor at the Media Lab. We were at a dinner recently where Danny asserted that the world could be simulated by a computer. I asked him to come to my office so I could extract this idea from him into a video.

We talked about the ability to simulate the universe digitally which obviously leads into the future of artificial intelligence, quantum physics, "why are we here" and lots of other interesting questions.

Apologies for the crappy sound and video. My default setup didn't work on the network so I had to use the camera on my Laptop.

I streamed it on Facebook Live and have posted an edited video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdooWeL5i4I) and audio on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/joi-ito/danny-hillis-and-joi-ito) and [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/conversation-danny-hillis/id1149206722?i=1000375006227&mt=2).
