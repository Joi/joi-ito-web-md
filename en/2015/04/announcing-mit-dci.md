As Bitcoin continues to gain momentum and capture the interest of entrepreneurs, hackers, businesses, policymakers, and academics, we have decided to launch an Initiative at the MIT Media Lab, with participation from faculty and students from across the Institute, focusing on Bitcoin and more generally cryptocurrencies.

The Initiative will explore vital research topics that our faculty and students will engage in with the support and participation of some Media Lab member companies. The students running the [MIT Bitcoin Club](http://bitcoin.mit.edu/), the [MIT Bitcoin Project](http://mitbitcoinproject.org/), and the various events including the [Bitcoin Expo](http://mitbitcoinexpo.org/) have been a key part of getting this initiative started. The MIT Bitcoin Expo, which was hosted by MIT Bitcoin Club President [Jonathan Harvey-Buschel](https://twitter.com/jonhbit) and Wellesley Bitcoin Club President [Jinglan Wang](https://twitter.com/jinglanw) this year exemplified the kind of interscholastic collaboration and excitement over Bitcoin research that we want to see going forward.

The Media Lab has hired former White House senior advisor for mobile and data innovation, [Brian Forde](https://twitter.com/brianforde) to lead the overall effort along with MIT CSAIL's [Nickolai Zeldovich](http://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/), a highly distinguished professor in security and distributed systems, who will be coordinating the research and academics. [Jeremy Rubin](http://rubin.io), an undergraduate who helped run the MIT Bitcoin Project, will coordinate communications with the broader developer community and MIT students and will also work on research projects. [More details on other MIT participants can be found in Brian's blog post.](https://medium.com/@medialab/launching-a-digital-currency-initiative-238fc678aba2)

The Initiative's focus will be heavily informed by the work done by the Bitcoin community, as well as by companies and forward-thinking policy makers. We hope to be able to contribute academically and technically to the field, following the [great example set by Princeton and others](http://www.jbonneau.com/doc/BMCNKF15-IEEESP-bitcoin.pdf). This is more about rallying interest within the MIT community than forming a general long-term solution for Bitcoin development and governance.

As I've said in a [previous blog post](http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2015/01/23/why-bitcoin-is-.html) and my talk at the [MIT Bitcoin Expo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIgjogLipvk), I do think there is a real need for a coordinating function around standards and policy. I believe that this effort must be multinational and multistakeholder. Continuing discussion with the [Berkman Center at Harvard](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu), [Stanford Center for Internet and Society](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu), and Oxford University will, we hope, contribute to the broader conversation on this matter.

See the [post by Brian on the Media Lab blog](https://medium.com/@medialab/launching-a-digital-currency-initiative-238fc678aba2) for more information about the Initiative. We've set up an IRC channel irc.freenode.net/#mit-dci, where we will be hanging out. We look forward to your feedback and ideas for collaboration.
