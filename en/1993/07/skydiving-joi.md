This is a picture of me hanging from a wing of an airplane. I have only gone once, but skydiving was much more serene and a lot less scary that I thought it would. I would love to go again, but it is difficult to do in Japan.

When I visited Seattle with the MacZone Japan team, we (I) decided that we should all jump out of an airplane together to "bond" as we set out on this venture.
