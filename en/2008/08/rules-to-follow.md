You know when you lose your connection and both sides frantically try to call each other back and cross paths? [Richard Wolpert has a new rule:](http://rwolpert.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/05/rules-to-follow.html)

1. if you initiated the call and it drops you call the other person back.
2. if you received the call and it drops you just wait for the call back.

Pass it on.
