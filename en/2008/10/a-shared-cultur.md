> We were fortunate to have renowned filmmaker [Jesse Dylan](http://www.form.tv/jesse2/bio.php) (director of the Emmy Award-winning ["Yes We Can"](http://my.barackobama.com/page/invite/yeswecanvideo) video) offer to create a short film explaining the ideas behind Creative Commons. He interviewed CC board members [Hal Abelson](http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#1), [James Boyle](http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#2), [Joi Ito](http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#22), [Michael Carroll](http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#3), [Lawrence Lessig](http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#0), [Molly Shaffer Van Houweling](http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#9), [Eric Saltzman](http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#5), [Jimmy Wales](http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#57), and [Laurie Racine](http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#56) and used the results as the basis for this terrific piece, entitled A Shared - Culture.
