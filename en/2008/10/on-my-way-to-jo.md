I'm in Toronto on my way to Amman, Jordan.

I'll be speaking at 11 AM on Wednesday the 29th of October, 2008 at the Talal Abu Ghazaleh College of Business / Jordanian German University. I'll be talking about Creative Commons followed by a panel discussing including our Jordanian CC country lead Ziad.

Look forward to seeing everyone there and thanks to everyone on the Abu Ghazaleh team for organizing this.
