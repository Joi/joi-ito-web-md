> The creativity of Asia's people will be supported and shared thanks to a new long-term strategic collaboration between the [DotAsia Organisation](http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/www.registry.asia) and Creative Commons (CC).
>
> DotAsia, the not-for-profit registry operator for the ".Asia" Internet top-level domain, plans to commit US$100,000 to Creative Commons in support of its cause, outreach and community efforts in Asia. In addition, DotAsia will contribute time and effort into assisting in the coordination of events, activities of CC's regional chapters and various other socio-technical initiatives, such as a next generation copyright registry project.
>
> The collaboration will be announced by the CEO of Creative Commons, Mr. Joi Ito, and Mr. Edmon Chung, the CEO of DotAsia, during the launch ceremony next Saturday afternoon (Oct 25) for Creative Commons Hong Kong (CCHK) at the HKICC Lee Shau Kee School of Creativity, Kowloon, Hong Kong. For more details about the launch event visit CCHK's [website](http://hk.creativecommons.org/).

It also helps strengthen our connection to the worldwide IPR community. Stay tuned [here](http://www.creativecommons.asia/) for CC activities in Asia."
