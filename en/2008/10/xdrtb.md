The photographs

> I thought you should see these photographs. They're both powerful and moving. They highlight the awful disease XDR -TB, a new and deadly form of tuberculosis that is threatening to become a global pandemic.
>
> By viewing and passing on this link we can help to spread awareness, which is the first step to halting the disease. [XDRTB.ORG](http://www.xdrtb.org/) (http://www.xdrtb.org/)
>
> (As background, the photographs were taken by leading photojournalist James Nachtwey and were 'unveiled' on October 3rd, 2008 in more than 50 cities on seven continents as a deliberate attempt to highlight this new danger faced by the world.)

I first learned about drug resistant TB when I read [Mountains Beyond Mountains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountains_Beyond_Mountains) by [Paul Farmer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Farmer). (Thanks for giving me that book [Reid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman).)

These photos add another level of reality to the story that Doctor Farmer tells and also reminds me that I really haven't done anything about it.

If you don't know about XDR - TB, watch this slideshow and visit [the site](http://www.xdrtb.org/).

As an amateur photographer I found the following talk by James Natchwey very powerful.
