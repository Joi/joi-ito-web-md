Martti Ahtisaari, [Marko](http://ahtisaari.typepad.com/)'s father, [just won the Nobel Peace Prize](http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2008/index.html). Martti "is a former President of Finland (1994-2000) and a United Nations diplomat and mediator, noted for his international peace work.

Ahtisaari's most recent appointment was as UN Special Envoy at the Kosovo status process negotiations, aimed at resolving a long-running dispute in Kosovo which declared its independence from Serbia in 2008." ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martti_Ahtisaari))

Marko is an old friend that I've known and worked with for many years and have had the opportunity to meet his father Martti on several occasions. I was always impressed by Martti's strong, patient and thoughtful style. [It is also interesting to note that Marko embodies many of Martti's qualities and demeanor.](http://flickr.com/photos/joi/2578671069/)

Congratulations on a very well-deserved award and thank you for your contribution to world peace.
