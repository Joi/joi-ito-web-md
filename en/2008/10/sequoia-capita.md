Sequoia Capital sent this to their CEO's. It's a good presentation and hope all of the CEOs of my companies will take a look at it too.

I think it's important not to panic and remember that some of the best companies are made during tough time. Most of the best companies that I invested in were founded during the bottom of the last downturn. I think from an investor perspective, it's periods like there where we get to see how entrepreneurs handle tough decisions. It's also a good chance to see how investors behaving during tough times as well.

I've built some of my best personal relationships during tough times.

Clearly, things are going to be challenging and quite painful for many, but I think that this is a great chance to "get back in shape."

Just remember... don't panic.
