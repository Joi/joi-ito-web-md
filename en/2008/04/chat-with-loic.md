I ran into Loic at [MIPTV](http://www.miptv.com/) in Cannes where I was giving a talk about Creative Commons. MIPTV is "The World's Audiovisual and Digital Content Market" attended by television and mobile phone content industry people. [When we were walking along the beach, Loic did a video interview.](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2008/04/joi-ito-explain.html) I got a bit carried away and blunt in the interview. ;-) Apologies for being a bit rude to the champagne-drinking participants of the meeting.

The conference was focused on commercial content so I was talking mostly about CC in the context of marketing. Obviously, there are many other reasons for CC including free culture, open courseware, research, etc.
