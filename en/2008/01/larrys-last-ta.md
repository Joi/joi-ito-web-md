[Larry blogs that](http://lessig.org/blog/2008/01/last_free_culture_lecture_firs.html):
> Last Free Culture lecture, first thought about what to do about political corruption

So this Thursday, January 31, at 1:00pm, at Memorial Auditorium on the Stanford Campus ([directions](http://www.stanford.edu/dept/drama/maps.html#directions)) ([map](http://campus-map.stanford.edu/index.cfm?ID=08-300)), I will be giving my last lecture about "Free Culture." The event is a bit staged (literally), as it is being sponsored by an entity making a film about these issues, and they want the lecture to use in the film. But the venue is beautiful, and I will also use the opportunity to map out one plan for addressing the problem of "corruption" ([as I've described it](http://lessig.org/blog/2007/10/corruption_lecture_alpha_versi_1.html)) in politics. I've now finished a draft of the talk; for those who have seen me speak before, it is new (almost completely new -- maybe 1% are must have slides from the past). For those who haven't seen me speak before, it will be a nice map of where this debate has been, and where I think I want to go. Any questions about logistics, send an email [here](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c0ada5ad9fa1b5a49fa5b6a5aeb480b0afa2afb8eea3afad).I'll be there. If you're in the area, please come. It should be an important/great talk.

[Daily Kos speculates](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/1/28/17417/9265/514/444926) that Larry should run for Congress and is running a poll. 83% are saying yes as of this posting. ;-)
