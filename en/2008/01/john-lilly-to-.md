John Lilly is moving from the COO role to the CEO role at Mozilla. Mitchell will continue to work with the organization in her various roles such as Chairman of the Mozilla Foundation, Chairman of the Mozilla Corporation, and Chief Lizard Wrangler of the project. This change was driven by Mitchell as much as anyone else and is a very friendly an natural thing as the organization grows.

Anyway, congrats to everyone involved. Please see [John's blog post](http://john.jubjubs.net/2008/01/07/my-new-job-at-mozilla/) and [Mitchell's blog post](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/mitchell/archives/2008/01/mozilla_corporation_ceo_and_ch.html) for more details.
