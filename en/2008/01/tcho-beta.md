My [TCHO](http://tcho.com/) Beta arrived. YUM! TCHO is one of my rare non-Internet investments. Several years ago, my old friend Timothy Childs told me he was starting a chocolate factory. I thought he was totally crazy. I sort of tried to ignore it for awhile, but he didn't give up and appeared to continue getting more and more excited. Finally he said he had sort of gotten things set up and invited me over to his super-secret lab and showed me around. I was really impressed. He told me his secret plans and said that my old friends Jane and Louis (the founders of Wired) were investors. He gave me some chocolate nibs to take home and put on my salad.

While I munched on the nibs I thought a lot about how fun it would be to be involved in a chocolate factory and when Louis took the CEO role and invited me in to their friends and family investor round I jumped at the chance. Anyway, the hardest part about being an investor in TCHO was keeping it secret.

Now you can order the beta C Ghana 0.2x from the site and tell us what you think.
