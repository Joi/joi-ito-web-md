I Twittered this but forgot to blog it. :-P

From the [Twitter Blog](http://blog.twitter.com/2008/01/twitter-in-japan.html):
> Despite the fact that Twitter is in English, we continue to see exciting growth from all over the world. Japan, in particular shows a very strong and growing demand for Twitter services. [Movatwitter](http://movatwitter.jp/) and [Twitterpod](http://drikin.com/twitterpod/) are great examples.

To support continued growth in Japan, Twitter has formed a partnership with [Digital Garage](http://www.garage.co.jp/en/) to create the official Twitter Japan service. As part of this arrangement, Digital Garage has made an investment in Twitter, Inc and will commit engineering and other development resources to help us bring Twitter to Japan.

We're really excited about Twitter Japan because it's a big step towards our goal of becoming a worldwide communication network. We'll have more news for you about Twitter Japan and Twitter in other parts of the world as we make progress.Gratz Rocky, Minami and the team who worked on the deal.

I am a co-founder of Digital Garage and I am on the board. Digital Garage is a strong supporter of CC and the main sponsor of my lab. While I continue to do some deals personally, most deals that involve active support in Japan involve my team at Digital Garage.

BTW, I'm [Joi on Twitter](http://twitter.com/Joi).
