I'm in Dubai messing around with [Fotonauts](http://fotonauts.com/). Fotonauts is still in beta, but we just "opened up" the widget part. Here's a widget of a Dubai album I'm working on.

You can click on the CC icon to get to the CC license and the "Flickr" to get to the original Flickr image. Although the images showing now are mine, the idea is to collaborate on albums together.

PS: I'm an investor and on the board of Fotonauts.
