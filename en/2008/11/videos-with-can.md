[Scenes from Inbamura HD - Shot with Canon 5D Mark II](http://vimeo.com/2383375) from [Joichi Ito](http://vimeo.com/user927030) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

I just got home from Italy and my Canon 5D Mark II was waiting for me at home. I put my 24-105mm f/4 lens on it and took it outside. There isn't really much "action" in my yard in the winter so I tried to take some images scenes that sort of capture the mood of a chilly Sunday in Inbamura.

Shooting video through a camera is a very different experience than shooting photographs or shooting with a consumer quality video camera. I'm going to have to get used to it, although I find it fascinating. I have a feeling I should start story boarding. Normally, I hate using the zoom lenses, but for video, it seems much more important.

Be sure to click the "HD" button on the video to see it in full quality. I'll try to shoot something slightly more exciting soon. ;-)

If you [go to the actual Vimeo site](http://vimeo.com/2383375) and click the "HD" icon "on" in the frame, you can see it in much better quality.
