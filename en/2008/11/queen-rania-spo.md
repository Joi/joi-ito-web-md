As most people already know, [Queen Ranai of Jordan won the YouTube Visionary Award](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z-aQAEA7U8&feature=channel) for her [channel on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/QueenRania?ob=1). Here's her awesome acceptance speech a la Letterman style. It's really funny.

I love how many members of the royal family of Jordan have such a great sense of humor. I remember [a talk by Prince Abdullah at a conference I once attended](http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2003/07/27/off-to-aspen-to.html) and he opened with the line, "We find ourselves between Iraq and a hard place." ;-)

Jordan is quickly becoming one of my favorite countries and I can't wait to go back. My visit with [Princess Rym](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Rym_Ali) when I was there was really inspiring and her work in promoting journalism and film are important and inspiring. I think the openness and the skill with which the leaders communicate with the rest of the world goes a long way in dispelling some of the unreasonable stereotypes that the West has about the Arab world.

Congratulations [Queen Rania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Rania) and Jordan!
