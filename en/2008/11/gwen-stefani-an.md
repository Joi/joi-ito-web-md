> Pop star [Gwen Stefani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwen_Stefani) and her husband, rocker [Gavin Rossdale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Rossdale) recently welcomed a baby, Zuma Nesta Rock Rossdale, into the world. Many celebrities contract with a magazine to arrange an exclusive photo session that debuts mother with newborn. But Stefani and Rossdale took a different approach and hired their own photographer and put the photo online for the public under a Creative Commons [BY-NC-ND](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) license, along with some additional terms that allow all print magazines, newspapers, and blogs to use the photo - even commercially, with some restrictions. You can download a high-res version of the photo (and check out the additional terms the photo is available under) at [Stefani's site](http://www.gwenstefani.com/news/default.aspx?nid=17103).

This is a great example using CC to manage your own identity and image online. I've always been a fan of Gwen Stefani, but this puts her (and Gavin) in a new category for me. Yay! And congratulations on the baby Gwen and Gavin.
