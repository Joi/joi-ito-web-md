Wow. This is wonderful. Two of my favorite people and the two people who I know who are the most qualified for this job have been chosen by Obama to lead the FCC transition team. Congratulations [Susan](http://scrawford.net/blog/) and [Kevin](http://werbach.com/)! Maybe we'll save the Internet after all.

If the new administration keeps choosing teams like this, we're in for some really good change.

>
> Ms. Crawford is a former partner of a Washington law firm that specializes in communications law and recently left the board of directors of ICANN, a group that oversees Internet domain-name registration. Mr. Werbach edited Release 1.0, a technology newsletter, and founded Supernova Group, a technology analysis and consulting firm.

> The Obama transition team includes a number of former FCC officials, but under the conflict-of-interest rules adopted by the president-elect's team, many may be barred from directly examining FCC issues.
>
> President-elect Obama's office said today that Ms. Crawford and Mr. Werbach are part of the Science, Tech, Space and Arts Team that will be directed by Tom Wheeler, a former president of National Cable and Telecommunications.

Oh, and it should be "Kevin" not "Ken"... hmm.
