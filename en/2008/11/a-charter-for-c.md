I just got an email from [TED](http://www.ted.com/) with a link to this wonderful video by renowned filmmaker, Jesse Dylan who recently made the [A Shared Culture](http://creativecommons.org/asharedculture/) video. This new video below is about Compassion. [I've written about compassion in the past](http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2007/06/18/happiness-compa.html) and I think it is the single most important thing that we need right now. The [Charter for Compassion](http://charterforcompassion.com/) asks everyone to tell their story of compassion. Looks like a great project.

> By recognizing that the Golden Rule is fundamental to all world religions, the Charter for Compassion can inspire people to think differently about religion. This Charter is being created in a collaborative project by people from all over the world. It will be completed in 2009. Use this site to offer language you'd like to see included. Or inspire others by sharing your own story of compassion.
