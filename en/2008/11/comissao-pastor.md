Tomorrow is the [WITNESS Gala](http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/600/t/7517/content.jsp?content_KEY=4506) and we will be honoring WITNESS' partner Comissão Pastoral da Terra for its work to end slave labor in rural Brazil.

We just met Silvano Lima Rezende at the WITNESS Board Meeting. Silvano will be representing the CPT tomorrow at the Gala.

Here's a video of their work.
