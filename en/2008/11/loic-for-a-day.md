When Loïc was in Tokyo, we were discussing the election. Although Loic was hoping for Obama to win, he thought that McCain was going to win. I felt very strongly that Obama was going to win. We decided to make a bet. The loser would end up becoming a servant to the winner for a day.

Obviously, I won.

I thought about selling Loic on eBay, but I realized that would be too selfish. I'm now considering a twitter account or channel so everyone interested can participate. I still haven't decided the day, but I think I'll choose a day when I'm in the Bay Area so I can document some of this...

Anyway, I'm still open to ideas. Let me know if you think of anything clever.
