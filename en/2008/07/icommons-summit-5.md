[The 4th iCommons Summit](http://icommonssummit.org/) is being held in Sapporo, Japan from 29 July to 1 August, 2008. The summit originally started as a gathering of [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) country leads, but had evolved over the years into a global conference of people interested in social, educational, business, technical, creative, legal and other aspects of sharing, collaborative and open models for doing just about everything. I think it is the most interdisciplinary and global meeting of its kind.

The [usual suspects](http://icommonssummit.org/participants/index.html) will be there. This year, we have substantial participation from Sapporo City and should have interesting cultural programs as well as local Japanese participation.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to seeing everyone next week. Although there's only one week left, it's not too late to sign up and join. If you think Japan's too far away, you're not thinking globally.
