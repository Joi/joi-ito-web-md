> While this may seem like a minor change, it reflects the continued evolution of our mission to support best practices in open source software development. As the open web increasingly relies on protocols and formats that reach beyond source code, we encourage authors to apply an explicit copyright license to the data, documentation, and related media that complements their work.

Using free and open source software licenses for the code and Creative Commons licenses for the content makes total sense and I'm really happy that Google Code has decided to include CC licenses as a default. Thanks to DeWitt and crew for this.

Update:

[Google Knol](http://knol.google.com/) opened today, intended to be a platform for authoritative articles about a specific topics, also known as knols, by a created single author or collaboratively. The default license for a new knol is [CC Attribution](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). A creator can also choose [CC Attribution-NonCommercial](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) or All Rights Reserved.
