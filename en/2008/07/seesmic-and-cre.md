[Seemsic](http://seesmic.com/) has just implemented [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/). [According to Loic](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2008/07/creative-common.html), it was the most requested feature by the users.

The interface looks super-awesome. Great jobs guys and thanks for supporting the commons!
