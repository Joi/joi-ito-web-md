[We just announced that Esther Wojcicki has joined the Creative Commons board.](http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/8469)

> Wojcicki has been a prominent figure in American education. As the leading mind behind the creation of the country's largest high school journalism program, she has won numerous awards, including the prestigious title of Teacher of the Year from the California State Teacher Credentialing Commission. Most recently, she received special recognition for her work from the National Scholastic Press Association.

In addition to being very cool, tremendously wise and a great addition to the board in general, Esther's expertise in the field of education is very important for us as Creative Commons educational initiative ccLearn develops.

Welcome aboard Esther!
