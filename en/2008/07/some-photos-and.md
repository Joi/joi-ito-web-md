Max Levchin the Guitar Hero

Sorry I haven't been blogging much. I've been spending too much time talking. There are too many people who I need to catch up on.

My session did go better than I expected and I was happy to finally get to meet Quincy Smith of CBS Interactive who was the moderator for our panel.

I did manage to shoot some photos, but not too many. [I've posted them as a Flickr set.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/sets/72157606309307505/) If I get any tomorrow, I'll post them as well.

I'm leaving tomorrow morning for SF for a brief visit.
