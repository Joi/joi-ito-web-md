> Radiohead just released a new video for its song "House of Cards" from the album "In Rainbows".

> No cameras or lights were used. Instead two technologies were used to capture 3D images: [Geometric Informatics](http://www.geometricinformatics.com/) and [Velodyne LIDAR](http://www.velodyne.com/lidar/). Geometric Informatics scanning systems produce structured light to capture 3D images at close proximity, while a Velodyne Lidar system that uses multiple lasers is used to capture large environments such as landscapes. In this video, 64 lasers rotating and shooting in a 360 degree radius 900 times per minute produced all the exterior scenes.

Exciting for Creative Commons is that the data (although not the music) used to produce this music video are being made available under a [Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) on the [Google Code](http://code.google.com/) site.

The Source code to the software used is being made available under a [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

This combination of Open Source licenses for code and Creative Commons licenses for data/content is very "good idea".

*The code and the data not the music are available on the [radiohead Google Project Page](http://code.google.com/p/radiohead/).*
