I just arrived at [FORTUNE Brainstorm: TECH](http://www.timeinc.net/fortune/conferences/brainstormtech/tech_home.html) and noticed that they linked to my blog on the site. (Thanks!) However, I'm having some difficulty trying to figure out what to write about or what "voice" to use.

Compared to when I blogged this event back in 2002, there are a lot of bloggers here now. Personally, I blog a lot less. Blogging had become "work" and my blog had begun to attract such a broad audience that I had to write in an increasingly self-controlled and measured voice, which was boring.

Also, the tools have changed. I get more comments on [Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/joi/) than on my blog. [My Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/joi/) possibly has as many readers as my blog.

I probably can't write much about the conference sitting here in my room though, so I better sling my camera and head over.
