Greg Grossmeier, July 9th, 2008

Creative Commons held our first [TechSummit](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/TechSummit) at Google last month. This event included an update and overview of Creative Commons technologies, panels featuring other leaders in open digital rights technologies, and a look at the future, including the role of digital copyright registries. If you are curious of who all the speakers were you can still find the list on the [TechSummit informational page](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-06-18). Many presenters' slides are also available from that page.

For those that could not attend the Tech Summit can now view the entire event online thanks to Google (who graciously hosted the event for us). There are four 1-hour long videos available and they are broken up by sessions. You can find session topics and presenters on the [TechSummit information page](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-06-18).

The summit was a super-useful event for us thanks to everyone who came out and participated. Also, special thanks to Google for sponsoring the event.

The technological infrastructure is exceedingly important for the success of Creative Commons and as it becomes more pervasive, the discussion around standards and interoperability becomes more and more important. We need to make sure we involve as many of the relevant parties as we can and that we try to get things right.

We plan on continue to do these so your feedback on this last one would greatly appreciated and don't forget to sign up for the next one.
