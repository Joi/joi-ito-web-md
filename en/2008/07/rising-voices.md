[Rising Voices](http://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/) is one of the coolest new projects at [Global Voices](http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/).
> Rising Voices, an outreach initiative of Global Voices, aims to help bring new voices from new communities and speaking new languages to the global conversation by providing resources and funding to local groups reaching out to underrepresented communities.

[...]

Launched in May 2007 thanks to the support of a Knight News Challenge Award, Rising Voices seeks to empower under-represented communities to make their voices heard online by 1.) providing financial support to outreach projects, 2.) developing a series of participatory media tutorials, and 3.) cultivating a network of passionate citizen media activists to help encourage and support the replication of outreach trainings.Lead by David Sasaki and Rezwan, the team has done an amazing job in the last year bringing commmunities and projects online.

This is a dotSUB video recapping some of the projects from last year. Please take a look and register and help finish translating it to to your native language if the translation is incomplete.

Congratulations to the whole team.
