The FOO in [FOO Camp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp) stands for "Friend of O'Reilly". That's Tim, not Bill. Anyway, every year, he invites a smallish group of people to Sebastopol to hang out and talk. One problem is that since Tim has a largish group of friends, not everyone gets invited and this sometimes causes hurt feelings. However, I think that there is definitely a maximum size that you can make a meeting like this before it becomes less productive and I think it's just right.

So thanks to Tim and the O'Reilly crew for making tough choices, organizing everything and throwing an amazingly fun and useful meeting.

The last time that I attended FOO was in 2005. I stayed in a hotel nearby and had a great time, but I definitely had more fun this year camping and staying in my tent. If nothing else, the ability to ignore my jet lag and join the 24 hour conversation whenever I wanted was a lot of fun.

Although the sessions were great, catching up with old friends and making ones was the most fun. Also, hearing about the super-secret, face-to-face only stuff was useful too. ;-)

[I've posted my images in a Flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/sets/72157606108716088/). I think that the calibration on my laptop is possibly screwed up and doing some of this work in a yellow tent didn't help. I'll try to fix some of messed up colors. Apologies to those who look over saturated.
