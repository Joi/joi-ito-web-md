![](http://freesouls.cc/thebooks/thumbs/08-LUXURY-EDITION-ALL-a_all-2.jpg)

50 prints of a luxury box set and 1024 prints of a limited edition of [Freesouls](http://freesouls.cc/) have been run. These numbered and limited versions will be [sold directly by Christopher from the website](http://freesouls.cc/order/). Once we get a better feel for the demand, Christopher plans to print a general release which will be more widely available.

Thanks to Christopher for driving this process and for Boris on the website.

Now the question is whether the demand for this book will actually exceed the number of people who appear in the book. ;-)
