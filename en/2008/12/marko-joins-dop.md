> Today we're announcing a new addition to the Dopplr team. Marko Ahtisaari will be joining us as CEO, while Lisa Sounio will continue on the board as Chairman. We're very excited about this news. For the details, [here's our press release in full](http://blog.dopplr.com/2008/12/08/dopplr-appoints-marko-ahtisaari-as-ceo/).

Marko is a founding investor in Dopplr and super-qualified as a professional manager, artist and web savvy product person. I think this is a great addition to the Dopplr team and as an investor, this makes me happy. ;-)

Good luck Marko and the Dopplr team.
