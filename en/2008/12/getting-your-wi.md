As everyone should know, you are not allowed to edit your own Wikipedia article. The best practice for having edits made in an article about yourself is to add comments in the talk page of the article and ask neutral wikipedians to make the edits.

For awhile, I obsessed about the accuracy of the content in my article, but I realized after a bit that this was futile and now I go with the flow and enjoy my interactions with the Wikipedia community.

Sometimes the these exchanges become pretty funny. Here's an example. (Slightly edited for brevity...)

> dont want to come across as demanding, but can we have a picture without baby...? Its a lovely baby, but I guess if we have a picture of it in his article we have to establish its name and occupation, and origin. So no pressure.  
> by the way, I have created an article for Kevin Werbach and have submitted his and Susan Crawford's selection to lead the FCC review on "did you know.." If the nomination goes through (dunno, let see) this info should be on the front page in next couple of days. Could you upload a picture of him for his article?**--SasiSasi (talk) 16:55, 19 November 2008 (UTC)**
