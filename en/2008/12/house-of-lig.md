[House of Light](http://vimeo.com/2451040) from [Joichi Ito](http://vimeo.com/user927030) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

Joshua read about the [House of Light designed by James Turrell on PingMag.](http://pingmag.jp/2006/08/21/staying-in-james-turrells-house-of-light/) We decided to try to get a group together to go out and stay there. As usual, we both got so busy, we ended up going by ourselves.

The art installation/house is in Tokamachi, Niigata, which is relatively out-of-the way in the countryside of Japan. The area is well known for the [Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennial](http://www.echigo-tsumari.jp/english/). The [House of Light or 光の館](http://www11.ocn.ne.jp/~jthikari/), is a beautiful house that can hold seven people. It has a Japanese style bath, sleeping quarters and a kitchen. The main event a room that goes through a subtle light display during sunrise and sunset. The ceiling opens up framing the sky in the lighting around the ceiling of the room.

The whole house as a very Japanese-style attention-to-detail, a practical and livable layout and a well-designed art installation feeling.

I'd recommend it for any group of up to seven people who want to spend a weekend together in a beautiful and peaceful place.
