[Mizuka and Joi's Wedding](https://vimeo.com/2414317) from [Joichi Ito](https://vimeo.com/joiito) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).

Mizuka and I just got married. We went to the Inbamura town hall, filed our papers and visited the local Shinto shrine, Munakata Shrine.

It's the second marriage for both of us so we decided to keep it pretty minimal.

The only non-minimal thing was setting up and taking shots of ourselves...

UPDATE: [Message](http://vimeo.com/2564880) from the [WITNESS](http://witness.org/) team. Thanks!
