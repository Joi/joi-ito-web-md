I took my Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm f/1.2 lens with me on my last trip. It's a larger than my Leica M8 so I didn't carry it around as much as, but I tested it in various conditions and liked it. I'd been [focusing mostly on the video](http://vimeo.com/user927030/videos), but got to play with the photography more this trip. I am impressed by the quality of the images at ISO 3200 and 6400. It's OK at 3200 and sometimes usable, especially in B&W, at 6400.
