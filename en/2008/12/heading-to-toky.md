[Heading in to Tokyo](http://vimeo.com/2396726) from [Joichi Ito](http://vimeo.com/user927030) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

Today, I left my home in the countryside to attend meetings in Yokohama and Tokyo, ending up at the Century Hyatt Hotel in Shinjuku. I grabbed movies here and there and picked up a tripod in Yurakucho after getting tired of hand-held shots.

Still have a lot to learn... I need to remember to leave enough room before and after my shots for the transitions, among other things. Also, video takes a LOT longer than post-processing my photos... \*eep\*

Shooting moving things is a lot harder than taking movies of leaves waving in the wind. ;-)

Most of the scenes were taken with my 85mm at f/1.2 on my Canon 5D Mark II.

Make sure you watch this in HD if possible.
