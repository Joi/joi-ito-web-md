Elliot Noss, the CEO of [Tucows](http://www.tucows.com/) is an old friend. He's the one who convinced me to join the ICANN board. He's a fellow World of Warcraft guildmate and an inspiration to me in many ways.

For the last few months, we've been talking a lot about his company Tucows and I've been trying to help. I love Elliot's attitude and style and really like the staff and board of the company. I have joined their board and [we announced this today](http://tucowsinc.com/news/2008/12/tucows-appoints-joichi-ito-to-its-board-of-directors/).
