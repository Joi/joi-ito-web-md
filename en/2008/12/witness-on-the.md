> For 16 years, [WITNESS](http://www.witness.org/) has harnessed the power of video to advance human rights. In honor of the 60th anniversary of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.udhr.org) on December 10th, we've put together this short video with different WITNESS staff talking about images that opened their eyes to human rights abuses around the world. To learn more about the images mentioned in this video, [click here](http://hub.witness.org/en/node/11477). Now we want to hear from you.
