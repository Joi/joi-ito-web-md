[Six Apart Japan 5th Anniversary Party](http://vimeo.com/2406394) from [Joichi Ito](http://vimeo.com/user927030) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

Today was the fifth anniversary of Six Apart Japan. I had to talk about how it all started and tell funny stories about Nob.

I decided to try to shoot people for today's video. I experimented with timing my transitions with music. I used Garage Band to make the "music".

I was using the cheesy random loops as a place holder and was going to try to do a real track, but I ran out of steam for the night...

Also, some of the colors seem blown out and the white balance seems a bit off. I guess I need to start looking into either white balancing more properly in the camera or post processing the color.

I wonder how long I can keep this one video a day thing going...

I used a Canon 5D Mark II with a 85mm f/1.2 lens. Shot in 1080i, edited with Final Cut Express, exported to 720p. Music made with Garage Band.

Make sure you watch the video in "HD" mode.
