Reid and I [recently invested in Ping.fm](http://ping.fm/blog/good-news-for-everyone/). It's a service that allows you to update all of your social networks at once and is one of the few services I use every day. I've been talking to the founders [Sean](http://flickr.com/photos/joi/3119442373/) and [Adam](http://flickr.com/photos/joi/3120263072/) who I really like and am happy to be joining their team to build a simple but useful service.
