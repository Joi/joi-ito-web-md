The [panel discussion at Berkman Center](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/4832) was a lot of fun. It was with a very friendly crowd and we didn't have to spend time preaching or explaining Creative Commons. A nice change of pace for me. It was also very cool hearing some of the history of Creative Commons that even I didn't know. Jonathan Zittrain was great and hilarious as usual.

The panelists were: Jamie Boyle, Lawrence Lessig, Joi Ito, Molly S. Van Houweling, and Jonathan Zittrain.

One regret was that [Tim Berness Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) was there and I didn't get a chance to meet him... he was among the many many cool people who were there that I didn't get a chance to talk to.

Thanks to the Berkman center, our CC team and everyone who helped organize and run the event.
