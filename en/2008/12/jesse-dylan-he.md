**Making the Web Work for Science**

> Science Commons
>
> Science Commons designs strategies and tools for faster, more efficient web-enabled scientific research. We identify unnecessary barriers to research, craft policy guidelines and legal agreements to lower those barriers, and develop technology to make research, data and materials easier to find and use.
>
> Our goal is to speed the translation of data into discovery -- unlocking the value of research so more people can benefit from the work scientists are doing.

[Science Commons](http://sciencecommons.org/) is a new and important part of Creative Commons. Although it's based on Creative Commons, it's not as simple as "Creative Commons for scientists". There is a lot more than that and we've struggled to explain past this over-simplification. Thanks to Jesse Dylan for this great video helping to make Science Commons easier to understand.
