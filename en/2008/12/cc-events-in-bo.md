> On Dec. 12th, 2008, CC will be pairing up with two of the most influential and innovative institutions in the "open" movement: [MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)](http://www.csail.mit.edu/) and [Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/).
>
> For those of you interested in the tech side of Creative Commons, MIT's CSAIL is hosting [CC's second Tech Summit](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-12-12) from 9-4:30. The first Tech Summit, held at Google this past summer, was a complete success; those archived presentations are [here](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-06-18).
>
> And for those of you interested in CC generally, CC and Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society have joined forces to bring you the panel discussion: "The Commons: Celebrating accomplishments, discerning futures." Panelists include [James Boyle](http://www.law.duke.edu/boylesite/), *[The Public Domain](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300137400?ie=UTF8&tag=centeforthest-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0300137400)*; [Lawrence Lessig](http://www.lessig.org), *[Remix](http://remix.lessig.org/)*; [Joi Ito](http://joi.ito.com/), *[Free Souls](http://freesouls.cc/)*; and [Molly S.

[Jonathan Zittrain](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/jzittrain), of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society, will moderate. A reception will follow at 7:30 pm. Details are [here](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons-Berkman_Panel_Discussion_and_Reception).
>
> We hope you will join us in celebrating Creative Commons' sixth successful year and the culmination of our 2008 Annual Fundraising Campaign, "[Build the Commons](http://support.creativecommons.org)." This event is open to the public, but because we're closing in on the end of our campaign, we encourage you to bring your check books (or cash rather) and help sustain CC by donating at the door!
>
> Space is limited. Please RSVP by December 1st to Melissa Reeder, Development Manager, at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
