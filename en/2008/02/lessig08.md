> From Larry
>
> This site hosts this video to explain the launch of two exploratory projects -- first, a [Change Congress](http://change-congress.org/) movement, and second, my own decision whether to run for Congress in the California 12th.
>
> I have decided I want to give as much energy as I can to the Change Congress movement. I will decide in the next week or so whether it makes sense to advance that movement by running for Congress.
>
> Many friends have weighed in on that decision -- both strongly in favor and strongly opposed. Many more have joined [draftlessig.org](http://draftlessig.org/) and a [Facebook group](http://stanford.facebook.com/group.php?gid=13417986140) asking me to consider it.
