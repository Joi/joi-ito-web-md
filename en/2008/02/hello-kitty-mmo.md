Hong Kong - February 12, 2008: Sanrio Digital ([www.sanriodigital.com](http://www.sanriodigital.com/)) today announced the closed beta launch of "Hello Kitty Online", a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) based on the famous Sanrio characters.

Players for the closed beta version are invited to apply at the official game site ([www.hellokittyonline.com](http://www.hellokittyonline.com/)) or community site ([www.sanriotown.com](http://www.sanriotown.com/)) and experience Hello Kitty Online in advance of the game release expected in the second half of 2008. Targeting female players from their pre-teens to twenties, Hello Kitty Online is the first installable MMORPG to set its sights on this demographic profile.Woo woo! I'm so there. I'm going to start a We Know guild there...
