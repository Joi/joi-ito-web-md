In a [recent marketing ad](http://www.consumer.att.com/onlinebilling/), AT&T makes a really bad joke poking fun at people upset about their [warrantless wiretapping](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/12/18/warrantless_wiretapping_latest/). Bad taste. I think I'm going to cancel my AT&T phone number.
