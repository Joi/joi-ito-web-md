Here's my first [Flowgram](http://www.flowgram.com/). It's in closed beta right now and I'm an adviser and an investor. It's lets you put audio narration over a bunch of links or photos. It's sort of like a podcast with bookmarks.

One thing I learned when using it was how crappy my microphones are. This is actually a good way to get people to upgrade their mics since most people don't really get to hear how awful they sound when they're talking on Skype. So apologizes about the sound quality on my first Flowgram. I'll work on getting a better mic.

This is Abhay, the founder of Flowgram. I met him through Reid. I took this with my new Canon which has auto-focus. The good thing about auto-focus is that it's easy. The bad thing is that it often focuses on the tip of the nose instead of the eyes, where I want my focus. I guess I need to learn to use my camera as well. :-P

UPDATE: Oh, and the pages are "live". So you can hit "pause" on the Flowgram and click a YouTube video in a page to watch the video, and then "play" again on the Flowgram after watching the video to go back to my awesome narrative.
