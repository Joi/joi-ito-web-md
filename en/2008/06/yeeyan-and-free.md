This is a bit "horse-before-the-carriage" but I feel compelled to share and ask for support.

Since the end of last year, we've been working on a book called "Freesouls" based on portraits that I've taken in the last year or so. I promise to blog more about this soon.

As part of the book, we've asked a number of people to contribute essays. Recently, [Isaac Mao](http://www.isaacmao.com/) introduced us to this great project called [yeeyan](http://en.yeeyan.com/). yeeyan is a translation community site. [They have started working on translating the essays into Chinese.](http://pro.yeeyan.com/wiki/Free_souls) Sooo cool. They are about 30% through the translation process. They're looking for people to help proofread the translations. If you are fluent in Chinese and can help, we'd greatly appreciate it.
