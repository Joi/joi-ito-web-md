[![Download Day](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/files/images/affiliates_banners/dday_badge_fox.png "Download Day")](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/node&id=0&t=264)

Tomorrow (and today in some places now I guess) is Firefox 3 Download Day. We're trying to set the world record for the most software downloads in a day[. Do your part and sign up and download Firefox tomorrow (June 17th).](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord/)

Also, I think it's the best browser around now. [Here's Walt Mossberg proclaiming Firefox 3 the new browser champion on video.](http://video.allthingsd.com/?bcpid=716692140&bclid=742940077&bctid=1577985394)

UPDATE: The official download day starts at 10AM PST 6/17. If you sign up, you'll get an email with a download link... or you can just go to the Mozilla.com and get it after it starts.
