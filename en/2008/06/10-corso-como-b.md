The 10 Corso Como Be@rbrick

The 4th annual Corso Como [Be@rbrick](http://www.bearbrick.com/index.html) ([Be@rbrick Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be%40rbrick)) will go on sale tomorrow at the [10 Corso Como](http://www.10corsocomo.com/) shop in Aoyama. Be@rbrick collecting is a HUGE rage in Japan. This 400% larger, limited edition Be@rbrick made as a collaboration with the select shop Corso Como and Be@rbrick will go on sale tomorrow and the [manager of the shop, Mr. Yamazaki](http://flickr.com/photos/joi/2572085113/), expects people to start lining up for these sometime this evening and sell all 500 of the limited edition very quickly. Many of them end up on Japanese auction sites at huge markups, but most end up in the collections of Be@rbrick otaku.
