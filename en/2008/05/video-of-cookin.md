[Boing Boing TV post with the video is up.](http://tv.boingboing.net/2008/05/20/cooking-young-bamboo.html)

Ever since I moved to the boonies, I've posted photos and other notes about my bamboo shoots on Flickr and my blog. This year, after my first post about this year's bamboo shoots, Xeni contacted me and told me that I should make a video. With Mizuka's help, I made a short video of collecting and cooking bamboo shoots and sent it to Xeni.

Xeni and her team edited the video and mentioned that it would be cool if I could find some Creative Commons licensed music to go with it. I looked at some of the stuff that I'd made in the past and looked around online, but couldn't find anything that seemed right for a bamboo cooking video.

I asked [Keigo (Cornelius)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keigo_Oyamada) and got a, "hmm... Bamboo shoots? I think [Ryuichi Sakamoto](http://www.sitesakamoto.com/) would be better at that." I then asked Ryuichi whether he had any sounds lying around that I could use in a bamboo shoots cooking video. We showed him the video and Ryuichi thought it was funny and agreed to do a proper score.

Thanks you so much Ryuichi for the score. Thanks to Xeni and everyone at BoingBoingtv for getting this going and all of the editing. Thanks to Fumi for capturing and sending the file. This was really fun.

TAKENOKO (Young Bamboo Shoots)  
--------------------

How to slice:

Cut tip of takenoko at an angle. Cut vertical to down middle to front.

"Akunuki" process to remove bitter taste:

In a large boiling pot add:

\* Dried Chili X 3  
\* Rice "Nuka" husks 2 handfuls

Cold water 2 liters

Add takenoko with the cuts and husks. Full heat from water for approximately 20-40 min (until you can stick a chopstick into the takenoko). Lower heat as it comes to a boil. After completed, cut heat and leave over night.

The next day, remove husks and cut to smaller pieces and boil for 10 min.

Making "Wakatakeni":

Make 2 cups stock from "Kobu" (seaweed) and "Katsuo" (Bonito flakes). Add Thin Soy Sauce - 3 table spoon, Sugar - table spoon, Sake - 2 table spoon. Add takenoko and boil for 8 min. Add "Wakame" (seaweed) and boil for additional 2 min.

Top with "Kinome" (Japanese herb) and eat as it is OR

Make Takenoko rice:

Make stewed Takenoko above but use "Oage" (dried tofu) instead of "Wakame". Take the sauce from Wakatakeni" and add as flavor to rice in a rice cooker and prepare rice normally. After rice is done, add the stewed takenoko and oage and mix. Enjoy.

Note: "cups" are Japanese size cups which are 200ml or 200cc.
