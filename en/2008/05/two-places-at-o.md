*On panel with Jun Murai, the father of the Japanese Internet*

Today is the [20th anniversary of the WIDE project](http://www.wide.ad.jp/20th-ann/index.html) which created the Japanese Internet. Thanks to Skype (is there a good h323 client for the Mac?), I'm in two places at once and was able to join the panel in Japan even though I'm in the UK. I think Vint Cerf also joined by video. It is working much better than I expected considering I'm just on hotel wifi, although the connection is probably super-charged with Google magic. (I'm at the [Google Zeitgeist conference](http://www.zeitgeisteurope.com/) in the UK.)

Maybe I CAN stop flying around as much and attend these sorts of things by video... on the other hand, maybe I'll just end up having keep traveling and join panel discussion in the middle of the night by video more.

I realize video conference isn't a new thing, but it seemed easier and more casual than I remember it being.
