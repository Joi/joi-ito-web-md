The iCommons Summit will be in Sapporo, Japan this year. I'll post more about this event later. We'll all be there and you shouldn't miss it.

We're asking for submissions for ideas for sessions now so if you want to propose something, follow the instructions below.
> We are pleased to announce that submissions for the [iCommons iSummit 2008](http://icommons.org/isummit/) in Sapporo, Japan are now open. You can submit through the [online submissions system](https://icommons.pentabarf.org/submission/iSummit08/).

The iSummit is a global event dedicated to the exploration of global digital culture. We invite sessions on projects from different regions around the world, and on global topics related to the Commons and Free Culture.

We are accepting submissions for the following session types: workshops, panel discussions, poster sessions, sprints, presentation bonanzas, video, speedgeeking, podium, meetings, and other suggested formats (to be decided in consultation with the [iSummit team](http://icommons.org/isummit08/isummit08_team/)). The specific session formats are detailed [here](http://www.icommons.org/isummit08/session-formats/). Sessions are ordered according to specific [labs](http://www.icommons.org/isummit08/labs), which are spaces dedicated to specific themes, projects or mediums.
