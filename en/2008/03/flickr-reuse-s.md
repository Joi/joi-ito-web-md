This is a request from the CC team. If you've got any stories, please let us know!
> [Flickr Re-Use Stories](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8157)

[Calling all Flickr photographers and CC-licensors](http://www.flickr.com/groups/creativecommons/discuss/72157604237046599/) - we are compiling a list of interesting and/or unique stories of re-use of [CC-licensed photos on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/groups/creativecommons/) and we need your help!

If you or someone you know has had their photographs reused in an intriguing way, please send the story and corresponding photograph to melissa AT creativecommons DOT org. This is super significant in helping us explain to the larger community why CC is important for photographers. We have a short time frame and any help from those in the CC community is greatly appreciated!
