Jeff and I spent the day cranking on [our book](http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20121002120301-1391-the-future-an-instruction-manual). Feeling good about the structure of the book and we made a lot of progress.

One of the things I decided I need to do is to get my blog voice back so - hello!

We still don't even have a real title for the book, but we're close. Watch this space for more about the book as we get rolling.
