Since returning to Tokyo in July last year after 14 years, I’ve been immersing myself in web3. I’ve also been frantically catching up with everything I missed in Japan - the food, my friends, Japan’s mostly failed attempts at digital transformation and the new generation of Gen Z kids.

I set up the [Center for Radical Transformation](https://henkaku.org/en/CIT-henkaku-center/) at the [Chiba Institute of Technology](https://www.it-chiba.ac.jp/english/); took a new role, Chief Architect, at the company I co-founded, [Digital Garage](https://www.garage.co.jp/en/); and advise various government agencies and industry groups. I also launched a bunch of media projects. I have a [podcast](https://joi.ito.com/podcast/), a [book on web3](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E4%BC%8A%E8%97%A4%E7%A9%B0%E4%B8%80/dp/4815616469/), a [TV show on TV Tokyo’s satellite](https://www.bs-tvtokyo.co.jp/earthshottv/) network, and a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JoichiIto). I’ve been focused on publishing and interacting in Japanese, but I thought I’d check in with the Anglosphere to give you an update and **share this • [Notion page](https://joiito.notion.site/web3-in-Japan-1759097267da4666baf97d6506e86ad7) • on web3 in Japan in English.**

Japan is trying very hard to transform society in many ways, and it’s wonderful being back and contributing to the effort.
