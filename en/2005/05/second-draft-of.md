> I posted, some weeks back, the [first draft of a technical guide to anonymous blogging](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/globalvoices/?p=125). I've gotten great feedback from folks all over the world and have just posted a second draft of the guide on the Global Voices wiki, inviting collaborators to help me improve it. If you're interested in the suject of anonymous blogging, [please visit the guide](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/dyn/globalvoices/wiki/index.php/AnonBlog) and lend a hand in improving it.

Two, keep in mind the audience for this document - we're hoping to write a document that's fun, readable, technically correct, translatable, and aimed at activists in developing nations. We're not trying to write a document aimed at cypherpunks.)

As regular readers of my blog will know, I am a strong advocate for anonymity and anonymous free speech. Ethan et al have done a great job on getting this started. If you can contribute to the document, I urge you to participate in the editing on the wiki.
