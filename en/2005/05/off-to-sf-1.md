I'm off to SF again for a very short trip. Giving Ethan and Tantek a walk around my yard today, I realized how stupid it was that I didn't spend more time at home...

See you on the other side.

Thanks to Boris, I have [my Plazes map page](http://joi.ito.com/plazes/) to remind me where I am when I forget.
