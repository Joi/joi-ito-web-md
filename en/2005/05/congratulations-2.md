For those of you who haven't been following [Gillian's blog](http://witness.typepad.com/gillian_in_salone/) that [I blogged about earlier](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/05/10/gillian_caldwells_new_blog.html), their trip to Sierra Leone was successful and Gillian has done a nice job capturing the trip on her blog. Congratulations Gillian and Angelina and everyone else who was involved! Gillian says she's going to continue blogging. Yay!
