[The Negotiator](http://www.odoru-legend.com/), a Japanese movie which I helped with came out on Saturday and is currently ranked #1 beating [Shall We Dance](http://www.miramax.com/shallwedance/). I haven't seen it yet. I hope [the stickers we all collected](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/11/03/request_for_stickers.html) ended up in the movie. I don't think I'm going to get a chance to see it for a few weeks since I'm away again from tomorrow and running around until the end of the month. If someone has seen it, please let us know how it was.

In other movie news, I went to see [The Downfall](http://www.downfallthefilm.com/) with Larry when we were in Australia. It was a great movie. I think it was a bold move to make Hitler seem human. He reminded me of some people I know. I think it's important to remember that Hitler was human and that we always need to be aware of the risk allowing anyone to have so much power. A "must see" movie.
