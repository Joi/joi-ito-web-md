In the May 30, 2005 issue of New York Magazine there is [a story that included details about Lawrence Lessig being repeatedly molested by the choir director when he was a choirboy](http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/12061/index.html). The article covers the history and the current lawsuit where another former choirboy, John Hardwicke is suing the school with Lessig's help. As a friend of Larry's, it was painful to read the article and it was even more painful trying to figure out what to say to him.

Larry [blogged about it initially a few days ago](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/002912.shtml) and there were a stream of supportive comments. [Today, he posted about what we should do to prevent this kind of thing in the future](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/002919.shtml), and I believe this is a critical message to get out. He writes about the law in New Jersey that immunizes charitable institutions from "negligence" in the hiring of a teacher. This is what the defense is using against the claims of responsibility for the abuse. There is a bill that has been introduced to remove that immunity, but leaders from the Catholic Church have opposed the change. I often get criticized for meddling in American politics, but I think this is an important issue. There are links on Larry's post to pages about what you can do. I think the Church should be ashamed.
