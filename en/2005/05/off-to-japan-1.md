I'm off to Japan again. This time only for one night. Ugh.

Australia's been great. The talk was fun and the giving a talk right after Larry forced me to work on a new argument and new material which was good. The audience was diverse and interesting and I spent the day meeting individually with some of the people and have had some stimulating discussions. Lots to think about.

If you notice that this site is slow, that's because the last RSOD post was [slashdotted](http://slashdot.org/articles/05/05/08/2030216.shtml?tid=201). Hopefully the traffic will let up soon. For the last few hours, it's been pinned at something like "29.5 requests/sec - 273.8 kB/second - 9.3 kB/request". Amazing. (I bow to the power of slashdot...)
