I'm off to the US today. I will be stopping by San Francisco on my way to attend [Future in Review](http://www.futureinreview.com/) in San Diego. I'll be on a panel about Japan. Meeting Karel van Wolferen the day before yesterday was helpful since I feel a bit out of touch with Japan these days. On the other hand, I felt that my views were just reinforced by a "kindred spirit", but this gives me the confidence to state my opinions firmly.
