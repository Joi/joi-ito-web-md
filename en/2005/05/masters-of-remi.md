I sat next to [Dr. Roger Payne](http://www.oceanalliance.org/oceanalliance/oa_rogerpayne.html) at lunch. He talked to me about the songs of the Humpback Wales that he has been recording for decades. He is the authority of this field. He explained to me that Humpback Whales sang beautiful songs. They copy from each other, remixing the songs and add to the songs. These songs evolve over time and riffs get passed from whale to whale across the world. The songs have lots of interesting variations and even have rhymes. He made an interesting observation that the whale songs of the 60's were much more beautiful than the whale songs these days.

I suggested that he made some of these songs available online via Creative Commons and he agreed that this would be a cool idea and agreed to work on this. For now, you can find three of his CD's on Amazon.com: [Whales Alive](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000000UC/chanponorg), [Deep Voices](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000009S4A/chanponorg) and [Songs of the Humpback Whale](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000021YJV/chanponorg).

I look forward to when we have some whale songs on [ccMixter](http://ccmixter.org/).
