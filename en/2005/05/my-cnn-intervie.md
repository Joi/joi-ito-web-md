I went to the CNN office on Sunset in LA today to record an interview for a program that [Aaron Brown](http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/aaron.brown/) is doing. I talked about the evolution of media, [Global Voices](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/globalvoices/), spectrum deregulation, [Gillian Caldwell](http://witness.typepad.com/gillian_in_salone/) and [WITNESS](http://www.witness.org/), [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/), [BitTorrent](http://www.bittorrent.com/) and all of my favorite topics. It will be interesting to see what survives the editors. It's suppose to air Friday next week. It's likely that I will be out of CNN reach although it should be running internationally. If anyone sees it, let me know how it went. Thanks.

UPDATE: Regarding on-air time
> Scheduled to air this coming Friday, June 3.  10 pm edt is start of our broadcast. Could be aired anytime before 11 pm edt. Don't know precisely.
