After months of work by the teams at [Digital Garage](http://www.garage.co.jp/) and [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/), we are happy to launch the [Technorati Japan beta](http://www.technorati.jp/home.html) site. I noticed that some of the Japanese bloggers had already discovered our alpha site and some of the the feedback from the blogs have been incorporated into the new version that we launched today. Check out the Japanese [news talk](http://www.technorati.jp/talk/newstalk.html), [book talk](http://www.technorati.jp/talk/booktalk.html), [Japanese top 100](http://www.technorati.jp/talk/top100.html) and other features and let us know what you think.

We are still working on finding all of the bugs and figuring out exactly what the Japanese blogging community would find the most useful so your feedback and comments would be greatly appreciated. We will be working actively on improving the site and rolling out a few more features soon. Please feel free to comment here, blog on your blog send [trackbacks to our blog](http://trj.weblogs.jp/blog/) or [send us email](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cbe4e4b8bebbbba4b9bf8bbfaea8a3a5a4b9aabfa2e5a1bb).

Thanks again for waiting. We look forward to working with you to make Technorati a useful piece of the Japanese Internet.
