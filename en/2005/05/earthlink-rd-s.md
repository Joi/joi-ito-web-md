> Basically it's a demonstration of a [practical IPv6 migration strategy](http://www.research.earthlink.net/ipv6/). There is a sandbox that allows users to obtain their own /64 IPv6 subnet of real routable addresses (Goodbye NAT -- YEAH!)
>
> Here's how it works: Simply [get an account](http://www.research.earthlink.net/ipv6/accounts.html) at <http://www.research.earthlink.net/ipv6/accounts.html> to get your own personal block of 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 IPv6 addresses; install the [firmware](http://www.research.earthlink.net/ipv6/download/index.html) onto your standard Linksys WRT54G router, and blamo, you have IPv6. With this special code installed on your Linksys router, your IPv4 works as normal; you'll still have your NAT IPv4 LAN. But in addition to that, any IPv6 capable machine on the LAN will get a real, honest to goodness, routable IPv6 address too. It couldn't be easier. This works for Mac OS X, Linux/UNIX, as well as Windows XP. You don't have to do anything special on the machines on the LAN. They just work, as they say.

> So with this code installed on the router and your IPv6 accounts setup, nothing breaks. You continue to use your LAN as before, but you suddenly also get real IPv6 addresses. Easy migration. No forklift required.

This may be a bit geeky for some people, but for anyone who's been worried about how we're going to get IPv6 everywhere, this should be good news. Congratulations Earthlink R&D! I'm going to get a WRT54G router and try this out right away...
