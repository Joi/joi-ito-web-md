I just noticed the [Stealth Disco article on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_Disco) recently had an {{explain-significance}} slapped on it. This means that if we can't explain why it is significant, it will be [nominated for deletion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:VFD). Stealth Disco reminds me of the fun we used to have and it would be a pity to see Stealth Disco disappear from Wikipedia. Anyone have any good Stealth Disco stories or developments we can use to expand the article?
