We spent the day yesterday waiting for email to import and hunting for, digging up, preparing and cooking *takenoko* (bamboo shoots). It's nearing the end of the season, but there were still enough in our backyard for a few meals worth. [Last year I blogged a longer entry about the process](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/04/21/preparing_takenoko.html). This year I focused on the photos. We also used a slightly different recipe and did it without relying on our neighbors.

I've posted the pictures as [a flickr photo set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/sets/287196/).
