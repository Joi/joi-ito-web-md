Seth is one of the smartest and most interesting people I know. If I were looking for an internship, I'd jump on this.

Seth, if anyone gets referred through me, please do not give me the money. Please donate it to the [EFF](http://www.eff.org), [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org/), [the Metabrainz Foundation](http://metabrainz.org/) and [OSI](http://opensource.org) in equal parts.

Now for you tax wizzed out there. If this were to happen, is this a taxable event for me?
