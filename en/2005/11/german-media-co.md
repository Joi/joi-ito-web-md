Wrote a story about [Burda, a German media company that has embraced blogging](http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/11/13/business/burda14.php).

The CEO (grandson of founder) says he never plans to ever open a new printing plant!

Stock analysts fear they may be ahead of the curve in terms of going digital too soon.
