**By [Thomas Crampton](http://technorati.com/tag/Thomas+Crampton)**

What options to refer to bloggers quoted in the [International Herald Tribune](http://www.iht.com) blog-based technology page column?

- Shorter references make it easier on the reader  
- Longer references make it easier for readers to track the person making comments and encourage the conversational-style that will hopefully develop

BUT Hyperlinks are not yet possible in the printed edition (sadly).

So options include:

- Use only the first name of the blogger (as many comments appear)  
- Use the Blog/web address  
- Include first name and blog address  
- First name, blog address and a qualifying reference (author of XX book, etc)

What would make people more likely to participate? Concrete examples preferred.

PS: In preparing for the blog-based column for the International Herald Tribune I have spent vastly more time brainstorming and discussing issues here in Joi's blog than inside the newsroom. Thanks!
