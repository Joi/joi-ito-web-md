Interesting [post](http://www.edelman.com/speak_up/blog/) on the blog of PR man Richard Edelman about the future of media.

Extracted highlights:

> \* The largest 50 Web companies are attracting 96% of the ad spending on line.
>
> \* 9.5 million homes in the US now have TiVo or another digital video recorder. 64% of DVR users skip all ads and an additional 26% skip through most ads. The number of homes with DVRs is expected to triple in the next five years.
>
> \* Every dollar coming out of print advertising revenue for newspapers is replaced by only 33 cents online.

Changes to the media landscape are dramatic. I think many in the media industry have not yet internalized these numbers.
