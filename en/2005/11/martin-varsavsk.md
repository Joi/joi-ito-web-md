I've [accepted an invitation](http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/fon/joichi-ito-joins-fonas-american-board.html) from my old friend [Martin Varsavsky](http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/) to be a fonero and an advisor to [FON](http://www.fon.com/en/). [Cory blogged about this in October](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/10/22/spanish_isp_wants_it.html), but FON is a cool P2P WIFI service which allows users to share their WIFI networks with each other eventually creating a global roamable network. They're launching first in Spain but plan to push out worldwide.
