Calling Abbi in the studio to coordinate...

Abbi from the [Situation Room](http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/situation.room/) emailed me just as I was about to leave Croatia asking me to join [Rebecca MacKinnon](http://rconversation.blogs.com/) on a segment for the Situation Room today. (This is the second time. [The first time was in August](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/08/09/just_ichat_aved_to_the_situation_room.html).) We just finished recording. It will air on CNN Domestic 7 PM Eastern Time on Saturday and 1 PM Eastern Time on Sunday. Rebecca talked about global voices and I talked about blogs being conversations. Nothing new to readers here, but felt good having a chance to say it on CNN. I also quoted Thomas Crampton's post about how the IHT only gets 30 letters to the editor while we often get more comments on blog posts.

Abbi who runs the segment that we were in reads our blogs and is totally into blogs and new technology. CNN is lucky to have her. Her segment has a refreshing style and is something new... something we didn't have last year as far as I know. At least some of the main stream media is working well with us. I just realized that I was on CNN talking about what Thomas from the IHT was saying on my blog. Holy MSM remix. That's a lot of progress from last year... at least from my perspective.
