Funny clash of perspectives in the [International Herald Tribune](http://www.iht.com/) newsroom!

In planning for my [blog-based column](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/11/15/success_on_iht_column_pitch_and_next_issues.html#comments), I chased down the actual number of letters to the editor we receive each day.

We receive at the IHT roughly 30 letters per day, of which 10-15 are usable, the letters editor said. We end up publishing roughly six.

Historical footnote: We formerly only accepted letters via post, then we accepted fax letters (by early 1990s) and now we almost exclusively receive letters via email.

For a daily newspaper printed in 31 print sites around the world and distributed in more than 150 countries, 30 letters per day struck me as very low, but several colleagues thought it was "a lot".

I sometimes get more than 20 responses - many publishable - for a single posting on this blog.

Once the blog-column is up and running I will be interested to see how many letters to the editor we can inspire. (For the newspaper as a whole, not just for the column.)

If you feel strongly about an article or issue, the email is [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and please mention this blog so we can get a sense of the level of blogger input.
