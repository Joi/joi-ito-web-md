One opinion expressed by a member with samurai ancestry was that the Emperor should have committed *[seppuku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku)* (Japanese ritual suicide) immediately after the end of the war. Several people agreed. Others suggested that this would have caused a mass *seppuku*. They cited that under the Japanese *[bushido](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushido)* code, this would probably have been appropriate. I wonder what would have happened if Emperor Showa had committed [seppuku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku) after the war and whether he ever considered this. I assume that although he was technically bound by *bushido*, he was probably not educated in a strict *bushido* way...

There were other opinions that included someone pointing out that the Emperor did not choose to be the Emperor whereas Tojo and other military leaders chose their positions and should be more responsible for their actions.
