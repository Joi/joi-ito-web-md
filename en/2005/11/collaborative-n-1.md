**By [Thomas Crampton](http://technorati.com/tag/Thomas+Crampton)**

On Monday the Tech editor and I will pitch the blog column idea to the top editor of the [International Herald Tribune](http://www.iht.com).

Great suggestions when we [discussed it here earlier](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/10/21/collaborative_newspaper_column_wikistyle.html).

Current thinking:

**The Column:** Of about 700 words will appear occasionally (until we can be sure quality is high enough) in the tech pages of the newspaper.

**The Title:** Lessons Learned; Digital Conversation; Any other ideas? (Actually, any other ideas might be a good name!)

**The Form:** Could be broken into three sections of roughly 200 words or one long column if interesting enough.

**The Content:** Would come from you. Best, I think, to ask people to submit 100 words on a given topic. That would enforce tight writing and avoid the impossible task of trying to summarize a blog discussion. People could submit multiple items, but none longer.

**The Ideas:** Would come from you. But the topic would need to stay relevant to the issue of technology, since that is where the column appears.

Any thoughts? I need a strong pitch for Monday morning!!!
