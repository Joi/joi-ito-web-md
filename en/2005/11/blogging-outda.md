Recent thread on the types of [blogs](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/11/24/deconstructing_bloggers.html) highlighted something that bothers me: The term Blogging has hit the use-by date.  
  
Face it, the word "blog" does not have a beautiful sound.

More to the point, however, there are so many types of blog-like interactions that it is way too generic.

In the thread we arrived at three styles of blogging (they can be mixed in a single blog, of course):

1- Talk - distributed conversation that reaps ideas

2- Inform - links to interesting things

3- Opine - Puts forward viewpoints

[Sam Tresler](http://www.treslervania.com/) highlighted many uses for blogs:

- Organizational

- Personal

- Business

Can anyone think of a better term than blogging to describe what we are talking about?
