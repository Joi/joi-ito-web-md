Congratulations to the whole [Global Voices](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/globalvoices/) team for winning a [Best of the Blogs](http://www.thebobs.de/thebobs05/bob.php?site=winner_kat&katid=8) award from Deutsche Welle. The won the Best Journalistic Blog in English. ([More information posted by Ethan on the GV Blog.](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/globalvoices/2005/11/22/global-voices-wins-a-best-of-the-blogs/)) It's been almost a year since [we posted the Global Voices Covenant](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/12/25/seasons_greetings_and_global_voices.html), which at the time was really a mission statement for Global Voices. I remember Rebecca and Ethan were worried about whether it was feasible to take on such a broad mission. Clearly, they have succeeded driving this forward and continuing build the team and to foster the community into something really important.

Here is the manifesto again. ([Wiki translation effort on the GV wiki](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/dyn/globalvoices/wiki/index.php/Global_Voices_Covenant_0.2).)
> We believe in free speech: in protecting the right to speak -- and the right to listen. We believe in universal access to the tools of speech.

To that end, we want to enable everyone who wants to speak to have the means to speak -- and everyone who wants to hear that speech, the means to listen to it.

Thanks to new tools, speech need no longer be controlled by those who own the means of publishing and distribution, or by governments that would restrict thought and communication. Now, anyone can wield the power of the press. Everyone can tell their stories to the world.

We want to build bridges across the gulfs of culture and language that divide people, so as to understand each other more fully. We want to work together more effectively, and act more powerfully.

We believe in the power of direct connection. The bond between individuals from different worlds is personal, political and powerful. We believe conversation across boundaries is essential to a future that is free, fair, prosperous and sustainable - for all citizens of this planet.

While we continue to work and speak as individuals, we also want to identify and promote our shared interests and goals. We pledge to respect, assist, teach, learn from, and listen to one other.

We are Global Voices.
