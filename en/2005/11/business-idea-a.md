A 30-minute business idea in globalizing the many eBay sites around the world.

While it may not work for my bathroom [sink](http://cgi.ebay.fr/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=4419544947&rd=1&sspagename=STRK%3AMESE%3AIT&rd=1) on sale now in Paris, if you found items that were cheaper in one market than another and the shipping costs were low, you could safely bid in one country's ebay to sell in another.

This is something that you could automate for certain objects.

The idea was suggested by [Mahesh Murthy](http://www.passionfund.com/htm/mahesh.htm) at the [SIME conference](http://www.sime.nu/home.htm) in Stockholm last week and I cannot see anything against it.

The only hinderance is if eBay started offering such a service.
