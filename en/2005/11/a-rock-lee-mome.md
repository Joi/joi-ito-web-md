I'm at the San Francisco airport and after a long wait in line at security, a big grumpy-looking security officer looked at the [Rock Lee](http://www.absoluteanime.com/naruto/rock.htm) sticker on my PowerBook. (My sister bought it in Akihabara for me.) He beamed and said, "hey! Rock Lee!" We smiled at each other and had a Japanese Anime moment.

Rock Lee is probably my favorite [Naruto](http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/naruto/) character. He is pretty uncool, has no magic and wins by just trying very hard. His teacher is also very uncool and they wear these matching silly green jumpsuits. It's interesting to see who people's favorite characters are in Naruto since they're all pretty weird and very different.
