**By [Thomas Crampton](http://technorati.com/tag/Thomas+Crampton)**

In studying blogs I have come to notice there are relatively few styles of postings.

In descending order of difficulty, they are:

**Conversational**: Asks for a response, implicitly or explicity. Often gets no responses but occasionally it hits a home run with a great discussion.

**Informational**: A "neat-o" style of posting that tells information but does not really encourage discussion. These tend to get links without comment. BoingBoing, Engadget, etc are very successful blogs of this sort.

**Polemical**: A posting that takes a strong opinion. These tend to get both responses and links. The responses, however, tend to be opinions. Can be dull unless you use it like a drunk leaning on a lamppost: More for support than shedding light.

Additions and comments welcome
