After spending several days in the Paris suburbs and filing stories non-stop all day today, a few things struck me.

I have written about [the first incident that sparked the riots](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/07/international/europe/07youths.html) and [today's latest news](www.iht.com) (more violence already starting tonight and plans by French government to use curfew.)

The underlying feeling I got from the young people in Clichy-sous-Bois - where the troubles began - is total despair with no way out.

Seems there must be [CK Prahalad](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0131467506/104-7587861-2287163?v=glance) opportunities for these young people to make a fortune - or at least a living - if they are given half a chance.

What ideas for businesses or projects that can bring hope to despairing young people in a high rise ghetto?

Are there successful models of what can be done?
