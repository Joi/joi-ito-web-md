Holy we the audience Batman! [Dan's on the cover of Aera](http://opendoors.asahi.com/data/detail/7023.shtml). Aera is probably Japan's biggest news magazine. Congratulations [Dan](http://bayosphere.com/blog/dangillmor)! Although I will take credit for giving a copy of the book to Mr. Hattori at Asahi, many thanks to Asahi for getting [Dan's book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596007337) out in Japanese and giving him great coverage here. Seeing Dan on the cover of Aera really made my day. Maybe Japan's not that bad after all.
