I will again be going to the Chaos Computer Congress organized by the [Chaos Computer Club](http://www.ccc.de/) in Germany. You know. THE Chaos Computer Club. They are one of the oldest hacker clubs in the world and they have an annual meeting. This will be the 22nd annual meeting. Last year I attended and gave a talk about free culture and Creative Commons. This year I'll be speaking about their theme, "private investigations" and am an "ambassador at large." I will work on [my talking notes on my wiki](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?22c3). (Nothing there yet.)

If you're in Berlin December 27th to 30th or anywhere close, I definitely urge you to attend. There are thousands of hackers participating in an incredible conference that rounds 24 hours a day. Activities range from the computer art to parties to a go (the Japanese game) lounge to serious academic presentations. As usual, I hear the Wikipedians will be there as well.

The conference has [a web page](http://www.ccc.de/congress/2005/) and they also have [a blog](http://events.ccc.de/).
