Defining the poor is common (The [World Bank's one dollar per day](http://www1.worldbank.org/devoutreach/summer00/document.asp?id=60) level, for example)

But who are the rich?

If you can read this posting, you are likely rich.

Anyone with a university education and an income at or above the lower-middle class level for an OECD country is rich, I would argue. Being rich is more about having time and freedom to make choices about your life than bagfulls of money.

Joi's [latest posting](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/11/02/falling_below_the_fold.html#comments) may suggest a way to measure wealth through a Technorati rating!

What is the best metric to define someone as rich?
