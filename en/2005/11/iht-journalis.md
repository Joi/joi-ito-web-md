**By [Thomas Crampton](http://technorati.com/tag/Thomas+Crampton)**

Dear All,

As happened in [previous posting](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/11/18/blog_etiquette_for_newspapers.html#comments), I am happy to revisit the issue of my guest blogging on Joi's site.

**Why blog with Joi?**

As Joi mentioned, I am trying to fast-forward into new media. Whether covering [war](http://www.iht.com/articles/2000/11/30/edtom.t_4.php), [disease outbreaks](http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/03/27/ward.php) or [eathquakes](http://www.iht.com/articles/1999/09/23/taiwan.2.t_2.php), I always head for the frontlines.

The frontlines in blogging include the readers of Joi's blog. Great ideas have emerged in discussions here on how to combine blogging with more traditional media.

If you want to shape traditional media's interaction with bloggers, please join the discussion. If not, excuse us and rest assured that I will not be here forever (see next question).  
 **How long will I blog here?**

I blog here at Joi's invitation and would never impose on his kindness. I will be launching the first-ever blog-based column of the IHT in the coming months and will migrate the bulk of my postings over to that blog over time.

**Is someone here paid by the [International Herald Tribune](http://www.iht.com/)?**  
Absolutely yes! I am a full-time employee of the IHT/NYT and have been for more than a decade. (Details at [www.thomascrampton.com](http://www.thomascrampton.com/)). Other than my salary, no money changes hands.

**Back to topic: Blogs and Traditional media**

Funny self-observation: Just realized that in my postings I have dropped the Posted by Thomas Crampton in favor of By Thomas Crampton. That makes my online byline similar to my print byline.

Also, my blogging style has changed over time. Specific quesitions get more useful responses than general ones broad ones. You need to know what you are looking for.

What other tips to encourage discussion?
