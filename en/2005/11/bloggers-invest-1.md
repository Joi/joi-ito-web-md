In France [bloggers have been investigated by police](http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/11/08/news/blogs.php) for inciting the riots.

Also, [my audiocast on the riots](http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=thomas%20crampton&date_select=full&srchst=m) for the New York Times website. (My first podcast-style effort)

Blogs and sms messages were apparently used to coordinate violent action on a large scale.

What should authorities do?

Is there an alternative to censorship?
