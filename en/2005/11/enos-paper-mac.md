My friend Kenji Eno was reminiscing about how cool the old 128K Mac was. He Googled around looking for pictures and had a hard time finding one. He was going to sketch an illustration of one, but ended up [making a cut-out paper craft version](http://blog.neoteny.com/eno/archives/008875.html) of it that you can [download as a PDF](http://blog.neoteny.com/eno/archives/MacCraft.pdf). Today, one of his clients called and said they saw this blog post and asked him how their project was going... I'm going to send him a World of Warcraft CD tomorrow...
