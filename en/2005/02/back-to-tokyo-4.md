Actually, yesterday to be exact. I just spent the day yesterday at [Living Tomorrow Amsterdam](http://livingtomorrow.nl.dotnet15.hostbasket.com/site/lta/nl/index.html) with a group of people from [Philips](http://www.philips.com/index.html) and several other speakers talking about the future. It was a great session. The interesting thing was that the speakers from a variety of backgrounds including Philips Design, gaming, online dating, mobile telephony and myself all had a very similar conclusion. Technologies should empower people to participate and interact and the future was about context and community. (Sorry if I've over-simplified this.)

I'm on my way back to Tokyo today. It was a short trip, but it reminded me again how much I love Amsterdam. Thanks for the hospitality Philips.
