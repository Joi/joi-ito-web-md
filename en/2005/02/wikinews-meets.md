We just had an [IRC chat organized by Wikinews](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikinews_Chat) to talk about how bloggers and Wikinews could work together. If you don't know about [Wikinews](http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Main_Page), it is an effort by the people behind [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) to use many of the same principles behind Wikipedia to run a news site. They've had an early success with their scoop of the [unrest in Belize](http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Unrest_in_Belize).

Anyway, it was a very productive discussion. [You can see the logs online](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikinews_Chat/2005/02/05/log). There is [a page about Wikinews and Blog collaboration](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikinews_and_Blogs), but it's still pretty skimpy. A few ideas that came out:

Exchange IM addresses between active members in both communities to coordinate stories. (See [page of IM addresses for Wikipedians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Instant_Messaging_Wikipedians).)

Create an RSS/Atom feed of new stories and hopefully for different tags from Wikinews.

MetaWeblog or Atom API to allow bloggers to post to some section of Wikinews using blogging tools.

Wikinews should accept [trackbacks](http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/). They need someone to help write a trackback plugin for [MediaWiki](http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/). Let them know if you can help.
