I received the following email and [this attached Word document](http://joi.ito.com/crap/ITOCeaseDesist.doc) from the lawyer at sms.ac. It looks like a form letter to me. I have no idea what activity they think is illegal and I'm waiting to hear back from them. Has anyone else received this letter from them? See the word document for the slightly different letter in its full color all caps glory.
