I'm off to Amsterdam today for two nights to give a talk at a corporate seminar. This will end possibly the first time I have been out of jet lag in almost a year. It was nice waking up at the same time every morning for a change. February and March are going to be [pretty busy](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?joi_s_travel), but on the bright side, I will get to see many of you soon.

Anyway, see you from Amsterdam or possibly from the airport.
