![Make Logo3](http://joi.ito.com/images/make_logo3.gif)

[MAKE](http://make.oreilly.com/) is a mook (hybrid magazine/book) and a website for do-it-youself gadgety hacking published by [O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com/). The team is my favorite do-it-yourself hacker Philip Torrone, Mark Frauenfelder of [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/) and Dale Dougherty from O'Reilly. Phillip tells me there will be a lot of audio and video coming, but it looks great already. Looking forward to getting my hands of the first issue and seeing what they have in store for us!
