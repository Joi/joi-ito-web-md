[Rony Abovitz blogged](http://www.forumblog.org/blog/2005/01/do_us_troops_ta.html) that Eason Jordan of CNN accused the U.S. military of murdering journalists in Iraq during a panel at Davos. The [official summary](http://www.weforum.org/site/knowledgenavigator.nsf/Content/_S13066?open&event_id=1204&year_id=2005) does not reflect these comments. [Rebecca MacKinnon, former CNN journalist who worked for Jordon corroborates the assertion by Abovitz](http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/2005/02/blogstorm_desce.html). [Little Green Football is tracking this in detail](http://littlegreenfootballs.com/).
