[Mac Mini: The Emperor's New Computer](http://www.divisiontwo.com/articles/MacMini2.html)  
by Jorge Lopez, [MCSE](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcse/Default.asp)
> ...The Mini boots up into a stripped-down operating system which Apple calls OS X, similar to the stripped-down WindowsCE OS found on many handhelds.
