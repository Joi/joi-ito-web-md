I [helped out as a technical advisor for the movie *The Negotiator*](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/10/08/movie_technical_advisor_the_negotiator.html) that will come out in May. One of the things I did was help choose stickers for the laptops of the hackers. Thanks to everyone who sent me stickers and cleared the rights for me. I've uploaded [pictures of the laptops as a set on flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/sets/140336/).

It's still unclear how much time they will get on the screen, but in the last two films, there were many scenes where people were talking over their open laptops and the Infoseek sticker took up half the movie screen. ;-)

UPDATE: Added poster and pictures from film to the flickr set.
