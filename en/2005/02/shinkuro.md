I had dinner with [Steve Crocker](http://www.icann.org/biog/crocker.htm) last night. I met him before through [David Isenberg](http://www.isen.com/), but since he is the Security and Stability Advisory Committee Liaison to the [ICANN board](http://www.icann.org/general/board.html), I am getting a chance to hang out with him more these days. Among other things, he's well known for being the author of RFC 1.

His explained the software that his company Shinkuro produced and I tried it today. It solves a BUNCH of needs that I had. It's basically a very cryptographically robust, cross-platform collaboration tool. It allows you to create groups and share folders of files, has a shared chat space (like IRC) and allows you to share your desktop screen with other members of the group (yes, across platforms). The shared files are transfered in the background and edits to files are sent as diffs which can be accepted into the original by the recipient. There is also standard IM with your buddy list. The great thing is that all of the traffic is encrypted. 256 bit AES and 2048 bit RSA keys. Each message is encrypted with a unique key, and the key is transmitted under the RSA key. This is very important since I know for a fact that people sniff IM and other traffic at many of the conferences and public places.

The folder in the groups is really nifty. You drop files into a folder and you can see who has received the files and see any changes that are waiting for you. This seems so much more organized than the tons of attachments and updates I receive before board meetings and conference calls.

It seems similar to [Groove](http://www.groove.net/home/index.cfm) in some ways, but is more lightweight and most importantly cross-platform. (Mac, Windows, Linux.)

You can download it at [www.shinkuro.com](http://www.shinkuro.com/) and for now it's free. If you register it, you will get all of the features. My id is jito!shinkuro.com if you want to invite me to be your friend or into a group. As I've said before, I think [email is dead](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/08/14/email_is_officially_broken.html) and I'm always looking for things like this that help me survive the post-email era.
