I've gotten weird email asking me to pimp stuff for them on my blog in the past, but [here's someone](http://www.site-9.com/blog/archives/000471.html) being asked to pimp American Express by someone saying they are a student studying advertising. He did a traceroute that showed that it might have come from [Ogilvy & Mather](http://www.ogilvy.com/o_mather/). Ha! It's like whispering a secret to someone in a stadium wearing a hot microphone.

If it is O&M, it sounds like Bullshit Marketing. Be careful!

> The term Bullshit Marketing summarizes methods where customers are not treated as empowered, smart and connected individuals, but as a dumb mass of idiots.
