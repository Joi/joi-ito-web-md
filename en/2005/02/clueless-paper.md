> Tulsa paper [threatens to sue blogger](http://www.batesline.com/archives/001274.html) over posting excerpts of its stories and links to its site. [Tulsa paper](http://www.tulsaworld.com/) needs to get a clue.

Reminds me a bit about the deep linking debate in years past, but even more stupid. Maybe a long time ago [clueless](http://www.tulsaworld.com/) people could get away with shaking their fist at fair use, but these days it just makes you look even more [clueless](http://www.tulsaworld.com/). The Media Bloggers Association sounds like a good idea though. Maybe we can make a special hall of fame for stupid letters to bloggers.
