[The New York Times has a story](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/26/nyregion/26video.html) on the kid who made the video of himself singing and dancing along to Dragostea Din Tei that [I blogged about earlier](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/01/18/ozone_madness.html). He is Gary Brolsma, 19, from New Jersey.
