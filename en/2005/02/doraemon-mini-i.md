Only in Japan. This had to happen. There is a Doraemon everything in Japan. For those of you who don't know Doraemon, he's the weird alien cat thingie anime character that has lot of weird magical things in his pouch. NTT once made a Doraemon phone. Now there is a [Doraemon iPod mini](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/09/02/tanaka_reelected_nagano_gov.html). I still like the Doraemon telegram the best. I use it a lot. [I sent on the the Governor of Nagano when he won the re-election.](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/09/02/tanaka_reelected_nagano_gov.html)
