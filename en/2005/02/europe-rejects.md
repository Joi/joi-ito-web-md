That's an understatement: the software patent issue is dead again in the European Parliament and has to be rebooted from start if the other side wants to get it through!
> > The European Parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.
>
> Politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law.

> During consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped.
