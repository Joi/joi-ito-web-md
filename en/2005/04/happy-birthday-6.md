One year ago -- April 23, 2004 -- about a hundred students gathered at Swarthmore College to begin "an international student movement to free culture." (Dan Hunter described the event in [LegalAffairs](http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/November-December-2004/feature_hunter_novdec04.html)). The event was organized by the students who had sued Diebold after Diebold sued them. The movement now has about ten chapters around the country.
