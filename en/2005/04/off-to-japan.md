Had a wonderful time yesterday at [Les Blogs](http://www.socialtext.net/loicwiki/index.cgi?internet_2_0) in Paris and enjoyed meeting all of the new people as well as old friends. I haven't been to many blogger conferences for awhile so I found the presentations and discussions a good way to catch up on what people were doing and thinking. Thanks for organizing this [Loic](http://www.loiclemeur.com/).

Take a look at the lesblogs tags on [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/tag/lesblogs) and [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/lesblogs) for pictures and posts from the conference.

I'm off to Tokyo today for some meetings and eventually a few days off next week.
