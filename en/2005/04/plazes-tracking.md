[Plazes](http://beta.plazes.com/) has just added a tracking features that uses [IndyJunior](http://www.bryanboyer.com/indyjunior/) maps to visualize where you've been based on locations from which you have logged into Plazes. Plazes is a cool site that allows users to register access points to physical locations.

This is my Plazes tracking for the last 90 days.
