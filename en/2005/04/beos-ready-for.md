Zeta is being released by [yellowTAB](http://www.yellowtab.com/support/faqs/show.php?id=1) of Germany and has applications such as an office suite and the Firefox browser bundled with it. Most BeOS applications will also run as-is. [Screenshots are available](http://shots.osdir.com/slideshows/slideshow.php?release=223&slide=1)." According to the NewsForge story linked there, the release could be as soon as next month.

Excellent. I was hoping that BeOS would end up as an Open Source project somehow, but I guess this is better than nothing. I will definitely be watching for this. I have a soft spot for BeOS. [Frank Boosman](http://www.boosman.com/blog/) invited me onto their advisory board when he was working at Be. I joined towards the tail end of their life when they were shifting their focus to Internet appliances. We were in touch with the Japanese BeOS users group. When Be Inc. blew up, many of the core members of the users group started a company called [Beatcraft](http://www.beatcraft.com/), which my company [Neoteny](http://blog.neoteny.com/neoteny/) ended up investing in. Frank Boosman went on to start Air Eight, which is now [3Dsolve](http://www.3dsolve.com/), which Neoteny also invested in. I've also [kept in touch with Jean-Louis Gassée](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/12/10/jeanlouis_gasse.html). Be Inc. and BeOS attracted some amazing people and it's interesting to see this revival.

UPDATE: From the comments: Rene - They are already selling this for months in German shopping TV (<http://www.rtlshop.de>).

UPDATE 2: You can [order it from their site](http://www.yellowtab.biz/cgi-bin/db2www/zet_art2.d2w/report?catname=Zeta) too.
