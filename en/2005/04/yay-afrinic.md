We just unanimous approved the resolution which makes [AfriNIC](http://www.afrinic.net/) a fully approved and recognized Regional Internet Registry to provide IP address registration and other services for the Africa service region. This is an important step forward for the African Internet community. Congratulations to everyone involved. Yay!
