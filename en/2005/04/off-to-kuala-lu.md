I'm off to Kuala Lumpur today. I've been invited to give a talk at a Philips meeting tomorrow. I will be meeting up with some bloggers tonight in KL. [Sign up on the wiki](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?kualalumpur_2005) if you'd like to join us.

UPDATED: I [uploaded the pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/sets/244809/), but I need help with people's names. Sorry. Can someone help me?
