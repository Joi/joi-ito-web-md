> [MacMinute](http://www.macminute.com/2005/04/15/nin/) has a story about Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails making the band's new single, "The Hand That Feeds" available to download for Mac users with GarageBand to mix and mash up (an actual multi-track audio session). "For quite some time I've been interested in the idea of allowing you the ability to tinker around with my tracks -- to create remixes, experiment, embellish or destroy what's there," Reznor says. Here's a screenshot of it on my Mac [(View image)](http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/images/2005-04-15/garage.) and [here's where to get it](http://www.nin.com/current/) (70MB file). [Here are a couple](http://www.tmttlt.com/) of the first remixes!

How excellent. This is almost like open source music. It's one thing to say, "hey it's OK to sample this." It's taking it to a totally different level to publish it as a Garage Band project. Now if only they would put some kind of Creative Commons license on it, it would be perfect.
