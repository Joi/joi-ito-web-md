I just saw [this cool image](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pmtorrone/9456281/) in my [1001](http://1001.kung-foo.tv/) flickr stream... which lead me to [Comic Life](http://www.plasq.com/) which turned into [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/9480996/) and [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/9481380/in/photostream/). I really should be packing. I'm off to Japan today. Special thanks to Master Willem and his team for letting me stay at their chateau.
