Tomorrow I will be going to Paris to attend [Les Blogs](http://www.socialtext.net/loicwiki/index.cgi?internet_2_0) the day after tomorrow organized by [Loic](http://www.loiclemeur.com/). Many friends will be there. I'm looking forward to it after going mainly to conferences outside of the blogging community these days. [Wired News has a nice article on it](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,67273,00.html).
