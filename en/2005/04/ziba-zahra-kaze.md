> [Rape, Torture, and Lies](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20050331.wxdoctor0331fr/BNStory/International/) An ongoing Canadian saga has a sad new twist today: photojournalist [Ziba Zahra Kazemi](http://www.zahrakazemi.com) was likely brutally tortured and raped before her death in Iran in 2003. Arrested after a demonstration, the official Iranian line has been that her death was an accident due to injuries from a fall. The ER doctor who treated her has now spoken out, after being granted refugee status in Canada. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahra_Kazemi) has an excellent outline of the entire story.

[Hoder ponders what he should do to prevent similar treatment when he returns to Iran](http://hoder.com/weblog/archives/013851.shtml). What sort of pressure can help prevent governments from doing such terrible things? Can we help protect Hoder? Hoder says that credentials from a Canadian magazine would help. Can someone help him out?
