VideoLAN, or [VLC](http://videolan.org/vlc/), is a cross-platform media player and is my media player of choice. It plays everything and I just love it. It would be hard to live without it.

VideoLAN is seriously threatened by software patents due to the numerous patented techniques it implements and uses. Also threatened are the [many libraries and projects](http://videolan.org/links.html) which VLC is built upon, like [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/), and the other fellow Free And Open Source software multimedia players, which include [MPlayer](http://mplayerhq.hu/), [xine](http://xinehq.de/), [Freevo](http://www.freevo.org/), [MythTV](http://www.mythtv.org/), [gstreamer](http://gstreamer.net/).

Multimedia is a patent minefield. All important techniques and formats are covered by broad and trivial patents that are harming progress and alternative implementations, such as free software multimedia players.

The European commission has just passed its directive on software patents, violating democratic rules and procedures to the sole benefit of big non-European corporation and Ireland and to the detriment of small and medium sized businesses (which comprise 99% of the European software industry) and free software.

The European parliament will now be taking the last stand against software patents in a voting for which an absolute majority is needed. Such a majority is hard to come by in a parliament with a low attendance level.

But not all is lost yet as long as you decide it is time to make a difference and take action. This is our last opportunity to fend off software patents worldwide, there will be no second chance for the foreseeable future.

[Signing petitions](http://petition.eurolinux.org/) will not suffice. Contact your local EU representatives and educate them [why software patents are a bad idea in the first place](http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/Patents/industry-at-risk.html) and why they must attend that parliament session to vote against them. Make it clear that they need to stop the [machinations of the EU council](http://wiki.ffii.org/LtrFfiiCons050308En) and reaffirm the power of the EU parliament, the only democratically elected EU institution. For in-depth information and starting points to get active visit the [software patent page of the FFII (Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure)](http://swpat.ffii.org/) and [NoSoftwarePatents.com](http://nosoftwarepatents.com/).

Wish us luck, we will need it.  
VideoLAN - See the statisticsI've been speaking to a number of parliamentarians in Europe about the danger of software patents. This is a really important issue and here is a good example of a typical victim of software patents. I'm hoping that [OSI](http://www.opensource.org/) will be able to help people avoid encumbered standards as part of the open standards initiative.
