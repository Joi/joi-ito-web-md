[I've just joined the Open Source Initiative (OSI) board.](http://danesecooper.blogs.com/divablog/2005/04/expanding_the_o.html)

> [OSI Page](http://www.opensource.org/)
>
> Open Source Initiative (OSI) is a non-profit corporation dedicated to managing and promoting the [Open Source Definition](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php) for the good of the community, specifically through the OSI Certified Open Source Software [certification mark and program](http://www.opensource.org/docs/certification_mark.php). You can read about successful [software products](http://www.opensource.org/docs/products.php) that have these properties, and about our certification mark and program, which allow you to be confident that software really is "Open Source." We also make copies of [approved open source licenses](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/index.php) here.
>
> The basic idea behind open source is very simple: When programmers can read, redistribute, and modify the source code for a piece of software, the software evolves. People improve it, people adapt it, people fix bugs. And this can happen at a speed that, if one is used to the slow pace of conventional software development, seems astonishing.
>
> We in the open source community have learned that this rapid evolutionary process produces better software than the traditional closed model, in which only a very few programmers can see the source and everybody else must blindly use an opaque block of bits.
>
> Open Source Initiative exists to make this case to the commercial world.

> Open source software is an idea whose time has finally come. For twenty years it has been building momentum in the technical cultures that built the Internet and the World Wide Web. Now it's breaking out into the commercial world, and that's changing all the rules. Are you ready?

It's an important time for Open Source with many governments and large organizations switching or seriously considering switching to Open Source. The people at OSI are dedicated to making Open Source successful more broadly and I'm honored and excited to be working with them for this important cause.
