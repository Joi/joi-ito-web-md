The video was taken April 16, 2005. I have created [Prodigem page](http://www.prodigem.com/torrents/torrent_479.html) with a BitTorrent torrent. It is a 18.4 MB AVI file that runs for 30 seconds. If you download the file, please keep it seeding for awhile so that we can have a few other peers.

There is no violence or anything so don't download it if that's what you're looking for.

UPDATE: [Oguradio](http://www.oguradio.com/) has converted it into a [3.11MB QT file](http://oguradio.babyblue.jp/mt/archives/video/SH_Protest.mov). Thanks!

UPDATE 2: [And also now on archive.org...](http://www.archive.org/movies/details-db.php?collection=opensource_movies&collectionid=sh_protest)
