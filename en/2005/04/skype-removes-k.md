Skype's Echo / Sound Test Service ([echo123](callto://echo123)) [used to have a woman with a wonderful Estonian accent](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/11/22/skype_echo_test_service.html). They've replaced it with a faceless corporate sounding voice. ([via pt](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pmtorrone/9642128/in/pool-make/)) Eek. Kerli has many fans. We want Kerli! Anyway, for any geeks who miss Kerli, you can fine an Echo Test with a face for Chinese Skype. Just call [echo-chinese](callto://echo-chinese).

Update: There is now a Japanese soundtest. ([soundtestjapanese](callto://soundtestjapanese)) The voice is definitely a Japanese woman, but she is also incognito. Also, if you IM "callme" to any of these sound test accounts, they will call you.
