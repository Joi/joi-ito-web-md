Just read the newly crafted elevator pitch for [Benetech](http://www.benetech.org/) in a letter from [Jim Fruchterman](http://www.benetech.org/about/bio_fruchterman.shtml), the CEO, Chairman and Founder.

His pitch:

> Benetech creates technology that serves humanity by blending social conscience with Silicon Valley expertise. We build innovative solutions that have lasting impact on critical needs around the world.

Webcams and other digital communication could give ordinary people feedback on results acheived due to donation of their money and time.

This would give the power of oversight formerly reserved for wealthy philanthropists.

Does this hint toward disruptive digital technology underming the NGO world with individualized philanthropy that cuts out the middle men?
