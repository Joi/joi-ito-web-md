Yesterday, [I wrote a post about the parked domain monetization business](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/12/01/the_parked_domain_monetization_business.html). Since then, I've begun talking to a variety of people here at the ICANN meeting. It is clearly a complex issue and I have decided to suspend judgement until I have more information. I think that these "professional registrants" are clearly a different group than "user registrants". I think we should differentiate people who buy domains as their primary business to people who use domains to use in their business. It could be argued that professional registrants "use" their domains to run ads, but I think most of these professional use tools like [Google AdSense for domains](http://www.google.com/domainpark/) which automate the process and does not require the professional to engage in the business of actually running a web site or service.

I am going to try to gather as much information as possible before I come to any conclusions. I urge people, especially those people who are in this business, to help me understand the issues and nuances. I've just started [a page on the ICANNWiki](http://icannwiki.org/index.php/Parked_Domain_Monetization) about this. Please contribute there as well. Thanks.
