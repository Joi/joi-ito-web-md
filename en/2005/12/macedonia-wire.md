**By [Thomas Crampton](http://technorati.com/tag/Thomas+Crampton)**

The entire country of Macedonia will be covered by Wifi, according to an announcement by [Strix Systems](http://www.strixsystems.com/events/press_release.asp?id=589FD481AC12856F3C201AC128@2BE8EA@1127C2).

There could be many uses for unlimited ubiquitous broadband.

Some of my ideas:

- Wifi webcams filming from a flock of sheep could make a great art project.

- Wifi webcams facing the stove would confirm that nothing is still turned on.

What other Wifi devices could be useful? (Even if it adapts current technology).
