Europeans seem to be taking their real-world battles online with different views on domain names.

Wrote on it today: [Cyberspace Unity Eludes Europeans](http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/12/07/business/names.php)

The EU wants people to use the newly launched .eu, while the national domain registries want people to use country domain names.

Neat fact:

> The second largest domain suffix after .com is .de for Germany, according to Verisign.

Do domain names matter? Hasn't Google killed the need for them?
