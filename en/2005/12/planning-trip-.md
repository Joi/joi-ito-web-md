I'm going to Berlin for the [22nd Chaos Computer Congress](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2005/fahrplan/day_1.en.html). I'll be in Berlin the 27th-30th of December. I'm going to be working on my [notes for the talk on my wiki](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?22c3). I also made [a page for my schedule](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?joi_berlin_dec_2005). If you'd like to get together or can recommend events that I should attend, please add them to the wiki. Thanks!
