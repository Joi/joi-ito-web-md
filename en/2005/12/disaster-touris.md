Turns out that disasters nowadays do not seem to turn away tourists for long.

From a story [I wrote on trends in Disaster Tourism](http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/12/13/travel/travelers.php) that is in today's paper:

> The number of leisure travelers visiting tourist destinations hit by trouble has in some cases bounced back to a level higher than before disaster struck.

> "This new fast recovery of tourism we are observing is kind of strange," said John Koldowski, director for the Strategic Intelligence Center of the Bangkok-based Pacific Asia Travel Association. "It makes you think about the adage that any publicity is good publicity."

Is the acceptance of disaster a good thing - because it shows people are no longer so frightened to travel - or is it a bad thing - because it shows a tolderance for bad things happening in the world?
