[![Dec505 Gala Frontcvr-1](http://joi.ito.com/dec505_gala_frontcvr-1-tm.jpg)](http://joi.ito.com/dec505_gala_frontcvr-1.jpg)

Last night Mizuka and I attended the Focus For Change gala benefit for [WITNESS](http://www.witness.org/) in NYC hosted by Peter Gabriel and Angelina Jolie. I first became interested in WITNESS when I [met Gillian Caldwell the Executive Director in Davos in 2004](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/01/23/ethan_and_gillian_chatting_with_some_real_activists.html). I started talking to her about blogging then. I [helped Gillian get her blog set up](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/05/10/gillian_caldwells_new_blog.html) when she and Angelina Jolie were headed off to Sierra Leone to deliver the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's recommendations to the government in May. [The blog was a success](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/05/13/congratulations_gillian_and_angelina.html). We've been talking about other ways to use the Net. She invited me to attend the Gala last night which was an amazing event.

The videos and comments from Peter Gabriel, Angelina Jolie and Gillian were awesome and inspiring. However, the main event for me was Ishmael Beah, a former child soldier from Sierra Leone. He talked about how his life started as a happy kid who played soccer in the streets. As the war swept across the country, he survived the loss of his family and fled from village to village as he watched them being ravaged by the war. He eventually ended up being recruited as a child soldier. He was able to leave the military and attended college and appear before us last night to express his hope for lasting peace in Sierra Leone. It was an extremely well delivered and moving speech and really highlighted the strength of the words of a witness.

The festivities were also great. There were a number of great performances, but my favorite part was when [Nile Rodgers](http://www.nilerodgers.com/) and CHIC rocked the house with their classics. They [did an auction](http://www.witness.org/News_and_Events/Events/Auction_items_for_Dec_5_NYC_Gala/) with some pretty cool things. The only thing I bid on was the Nano programmed by Lou Reed, but I wasn't able to keep up and didn't get it in the end. ;-)

In total, the event was the best fund-raiser gala sort of event that I've ever attended. It had a clear and moving message and vision, it was fun and it was extremely well executed. Congratulates to everyone involved.
