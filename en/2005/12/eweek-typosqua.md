[Interesting article in eWeek](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1903695,00.asp) about the business of registering domain name typos and how they game Google. "Some of the domains move around between domain parking services or between anchor domains over time as part of a 'multi-layer redirection structure' that makes it difficult to trace". [The bulk of the data and analysis comes from Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/SM/Strider/Typo%2DPatrol/). Again, I'm not going to "judge" this business, but clearly it's a large business that is becoming exceedingly complex with some cat-and-mouse going on. One thing I wonder about is whether there is a whole lot of incentive for the cat to catch the mouse if the cat gets a share of the mouse's take.
