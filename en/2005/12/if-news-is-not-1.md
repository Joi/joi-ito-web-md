English was already the lingua franca of science, business and academia. Now English appears to be fast emerging as the media language of choice. Al Jazeera is preparing to debut [a 24-hour news channel in English](http://www.journalism.co.za/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=3459&CAMSSID=642ea8cb95a9e0bafa86d59d5bf5a3eb). A TV station in Russia also started English broadcasting this month ([but got hacked down](http://www.interfax.com/3/112684/news.aspx)).

Recently, an ex-FIFA sports official praised the French newspaper, [L'Equipe](www.lequipe.fr), for some of it's hard-hitting doping coverage, including revelations about Lance Armstrong. But, he added, they just don't get the same notice because their reporting is in French.

His implication: If news is not in English, it didn't happen.

Have you seen any examples of growing use of English in media or backlash against it?
