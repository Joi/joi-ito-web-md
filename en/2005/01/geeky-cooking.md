[Cook's Illustrated](http://www.cooksillustrated.com/) is by far my favorite recipe database with their extremely extensive and geeky/scientific approach to cooking. O'Reilly has now launched [Gastronomy for Geeks](http://cookbooks.oreilly.com/food/). It's like a competition of cooks trying to be geeks and geeks trying to be cooks. Which reminds me... I need to go cook some lunch.
