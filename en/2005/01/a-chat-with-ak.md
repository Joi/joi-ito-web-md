A few weeks ago, there was an [article in Scientific American](http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000CB565-F330-11BE-AD0683414B7F0000&ref=sciam&chanID=sa006) "debunking" the myth of self-esteem. I've never been to therapy in the US so I don't have first hand experience, but my good friend [John Vasconcellos](http://democrats.sen.ca.gov/senator/Vasconcellos/) is one of the founders of the movement and my impressions about the movement from him were that it was important and useful. John told me that he thought the definition that they used in the article was different from the one he was using. He said he would get back to me on his thoughts on the article. I found a [thread on MetaFilter about this article](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/38470) so I participated in a discussion there. I was still having trouble thinking through the issue, so I turned to one of my favorite moral guides, [Reverend AKMA](http://akma.disseminary.org/). I decided to record the call and post it here in case anyone is interested in our chat. ([37 min 33 MB mp3](http://joi.ito.com/sounds/joiakma2.mp3))

I think the net-net is that overvaluing or undervaluing yourself is bad. Ways to help people swung too far in either direction are good. The US probably suffers differently, than say Japan, because I think more people in Japan get self-esteem from craft or professionalism compared to the US where I believe self-esteem is more highly linked to money. Creating enclaves of people or communities to help people feel happy about their success measured by different parameters is a good thing and something the Net might be good for.
