> From the 'Department of Supreme Irony' comes a statement by Howell Raines (the former Executive Editor of the New York Times) that [blogging is 'unsourced ranting'](http://news.com.com/Editors%27+Picks%3A+The+blogosphere%3A+Are+blogs+worth+the+hype%3F/2009-1025_3-5302954.html?part=rss&tag=5302954&subj=news.1025.5) (the link is to a News.com article that links to an Atlantic Monthly article that you have to subscribe to in order to view).

> First of all, Raines' statement is so completely ludicrous as to be laughable. Weblogs have a lot of shortcomings, but lack of sourcing isn't one of them. In fact, if you want to criticize weblogs you would do better to complain about the excess of linking to other sources and the dearth of original material. But the more important point is the one filled with irony. Here is Howell Raines, who lost his job at the NYT because he was at the helm during the Jayson Blair scandal, complaining about problems with 'sourcing.' You remember the [Jayson Blair scandal](http://slate.msn.com/id/2082741/) don't you? He was a young rising star reporter who was Raines' 'golden boy' at the Times. It turned that the way that he rose quickly was by not wasting time doing the usual investigative grunt work; instead he completely fabricated stories and sources.

> I still keep running into references to New York Times’ technology reporter John Markoff’s off-handed remarks that he does a blog, it’s called “Newyorktimes.com” In a recent conversation he told me that as far as he was concerned blogging is essentially the same as “stamp collecting” for the semi-retired.

We should have "funniest characterization of blogging by New York Times people" awards.
