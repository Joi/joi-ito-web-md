> [Blogs contribute to political reform in Iran (New York Times):](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/16/international/middleeast/16iran.html) Former vice-president of Iran, [Mohammad Ali Abtahi](http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/), said that he learned through the Internet about the huge gap between government officials and the younger generation.

> "We do not understand each other and cannot have a dialogue," he said. "As government officials, we receive a lot of confidential reports about what goes on in society. But I have felt that I learned a lot more about people and the younger generation by reading their Web logs and receiving about 40 to 50 e-mails every day. This is so different than reading about society in those bulletins from behind our desks."

Now if only Japanese politicians would read blogs and learn about the huge gap between government officials and the younger generation.

Iranian bloggers have done an amazing job and I'm impressed that at least one politician is getting the message and even blogging himself.
