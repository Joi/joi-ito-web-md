The [New York Times says](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/27/business/media/27adco.html?oref=login) that VW is upset about the fake ad showing a suicide bomber and a Polo. I'm sure everyone has seen a reference to this in their local papers. (In a Japanese newspaper, they had a hand-drawn story-board of the ad.)

For your reference, [Wizbang has links to the video.](http://www.wizbangblog.com//archives/004866.php)

And just for old time's sake, here are the snopes.com pages for the [Ford SportKa](http://www.snopes.com/photos/commercials/sportka.asp) and the [Nokia fake ads](http://www.snopes.com/photos/commercials/nokia.asp). (They have links to the videos.)

People used a lot of flash and video during the elections to express their views online. With more bandwidth and easier and easier video editing, video as a form of expression will continue to grow. It's interesting how the TV ad as a form is perfect for twisted humor because it is designed to be short and strong and people are used to the format.

[Jeff Jarvis has blogged his thoughts on this](http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2005_01_27.html#008966).
