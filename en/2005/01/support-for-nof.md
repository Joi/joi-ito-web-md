> Recently, we’ve reached out to other blog tool vendors to try to coordinate information about comment spam techniques and behaviors. As part of these efforts, we’ve also begun to talk to search companies about enriching linking semantics to better indicate visitor-submitted content (like comments or TrackBacks).

> The search team at [Google](http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html) approached us with the idea of flagging hyperlinks with a `rel="nofollow"` link attribute in order to alert their search spider that a particular link shouldn’t be factored into their PageRank calculations. The [Yahoo](http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000069.html) and [MSN](http://blogs.msdn.com/msnsearch/archive/2005/01/18/nofollow_tags.aspx) search teams have also indicated they’d support this new spec, and we’ll be implementing and deploying this specification as quickly as possible across all of our platforms around the world.

This sounds like a good idea. Take a look at the whole post for more details, but your support would be greatly appreciated.
