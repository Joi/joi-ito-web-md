The suit, filed Tuesday in the Superior Court of Santa Clara County, Calif., aims to identify who is leaking the information and to get an injunction preventing further release of trade secrets. However, in filing the suit, Apple identifies specific articles that contain trade secrets, indicating that at least parts of those reports are on the mark.*

> This is disturbing on many grounds. Apple claims (see the end of the story) that it's not trying to suppress free speech. Bull. That's **precisely** what the company is doing here, well beyond keeping internal secrets.

> This reeks of corporate misbehavior. I'm not a lawyer, but it seems to me that Apple's only legitimate legal beef is with its employees or contractors who are leaking the information to [Think Secret](http://dw.com.com/redir?destUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thinksecret.com&siteId=3&oId=2102-1047_3-5513582&ontId=1040&lop=nl.ex) and other rumor sites.

> I'm fairly sure of this: If the party leaking information to Think Secret had sent it, say, to the San Jose Mercury News or New York Times, and had those publications run the news, Apple wouldn't be suing them. Both have deep enough pockets to defend themselves.

This is my understanding too. Even if the source is "tainted" if a journalist receives the information unencumbered, they can print it. If this were not the case, there would be little recourse for whistle-blowers who usually are breaking some sort of contract at a local level for a higher good. Going after the news site is "pushing around the little guy" I think.

UPDATE: EFF is stepping in to help [according to Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/01/10/eff_defends_bloggers.html).

The [mistake](http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?NewsID=10579&Page=1&pagePos=1) is understandable. Here's our [press release](http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2005_01.php#002190); EFF's clients are the publishers of [AppleInsider](http://www.appleinsider.com) and [PowerPage](http://www.powerpage.org). It's important to note that the facts in these cases are different.

Update: The New York Times has clearly written, informative [coverage](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/11/technology/11apple.html) [reg. req.]; NewsFactor also has [something solid](http://business.newsfactor.com/story.xhtml?story_title=Apple-Suits-Spark-Bloggers--Rights-Questions&story_id=106.3139296&category=business).

Update #2: The [legal documents](http://www.eff.org/Censorship/Apple_v_Does/) are now up at the EFF site.
