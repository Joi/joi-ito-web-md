Sorry I couldn't say anything before, but the rumors are true. [Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/) has acquired Danga, the company that runs [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/).

See the [press release](http://www.sixapart.com/press/weblogging_software_leader_six_apar.shtml), [the FAQ](http://www.sixapart.com/press/livejournal_acquisition_faq.shtml), [Mena's Corner](http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2005/01/current_mood_op.shtml) and [Brad's post](http://www.livejournal.com/users/news/82926.html) for more info. So I guess I better clean learn [bml](http://www.livejournal.com/doc/server/bml.index.html) and make [my LJ](http://lj.joi.ito.com/) look a bit better.
