You can now query [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/) for advanced search terms such as [tsunami AND ("red cross" OR "red crescent")](http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&url=tsunami+AND+%28%22red+cross%22+OR+%22red+crescent%22%29) and it will give you all of the blog posts in order by how long ago they were posted that include the word "tsunami" and either "red cross" or "red crescent". You can then click "Make this a Watchlist" and create an RSS feed so you can track all new posts that match that query in your news reader.
