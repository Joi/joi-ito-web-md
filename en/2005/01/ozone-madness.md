There is song called Dragostea Din Tei on the [Disco-Zone CD](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002Q22A8/chanponorg/) by O-Zone. O-Zone was a little known Euro-dance act from Romania... until [someone in Japan syched some flash to it](http://ikari0310.hp.infoseek.co.jp/flash/maiyahi.html). [Then someone else](http://csx.jp/~damemushi/il/maiyahi.html). Here is the [original music video](http://www.musiqueradio.com/videos/vids/ozone-dragostea.htm). Then [someone made a video](http://www.funpic.hu/swf/numanuma.html). Suddenly, this CD is a hit and many of my friends are ordering it from Amazon. I bet they don't know what hit them.

This reminds me of the [badger badger/potter potter](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/01/13/potter_potter.html) meme and the [Yatta meme](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/09/15/irrational_exuberance_a_fanimutation_based_on_yatta_by_happatai.html). There is some peculiar element of certain songs that gets people's creative juices going. I think they have to be 1) silly, 2) in a foreign language, 3) have that "can't get it out of my head" element. It's the tip of the long tail wagging. Maybe artists should make synching rights available to encourage more of this creative behavior in a mainstream way... or maybe not. ;-P

UPDATE: [Seth was just infected by email](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/01/numanuma.html)...

UPDATE 2: [More on O-Zone from Stefan](http://stefanliute.typepad.com/branding/2005/01/the_ozone_craze.html). "The funny-looking name Numanuma is actually a repetition of two Romanian words, 'nu ma' (or, to be correct, 'nu mă') that are part of the lyrics of O-Zone's smash hit 'Dragostea din tei' ('Love in the lime-tree'). More precisely, they're part of 'nu mă iei', which translates into 'you don't take me [away with you]'... Think of all the paraphernalia you can, from ubiquitous (and annoying) ringtones onwards... The raw matter (that is, the original O-Zone music) is renown for its supremely dimwitted lyrics..." I want the ringtone... ;-P
