Jay Rosen questions whether Dan Rather has ACTUALLY learned his lesson.
> [A Short Letter to Dan Rather](http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2005/01/12/rathr_ltr.html)

**"So I kind of resent your attitude toward your numerous critics who operate their own self-published sites on the Web. They were being more accurate than you were, much of the time. I don't speak for them, but I know my own archive." Plus: Lose the spokesperson, Dan. Hire your own blogger.**

Dear Dan Rather: "Lest anyone have any doubt," you said in your [statement](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20050112/d_mediamix12.art.htm) yesterday, "I have read the report, I take it seriously, and I shall keep its lessons well in mind."

I'm afraid I still have my doubts. Perhaps these would be lessened if, for example, you had bothered to spell out which lessons you saw for yourself, and for CBS News in the review panel's [report](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/01/10/national/main665727.shtml).

\* Was it the lesson about the deadly consequences of dismissing criticism because you think you know the motivations of the critics?  
\* Was the lesson that a prudent journalist ought to fear and respect the fact-checking powers of the Internet?  
\* Or was it that by stretching yourself thin you had stretched thin the credibility of the very network you thought you were serving by taking so many assignments?  
\* Maybe the lesson is not to apologize when you think you did nothing wrong.[Dan Gillmor also chimes in.](http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots/2005/01/jay_rosen_asks_.html)
