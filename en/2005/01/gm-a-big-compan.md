> GM's vice chairman now has a blog. According to [Neville Hobson](http://nevon.typepad.com/nevon/2005/01/general_motors_.html), this is the first Fortune 100 company to do this. The interesting thing is not how revolutionary this blog is, but how ordinary it feels.

It sounds "ordinary" and I think it's great. It really sounds like a voice. I've been trying to get the Sony execs to blog, so this is a timely example. Thanks for the link Antoin.
