Silicon Valley 100 is a project by Auren Hoffman. I was lucky enough to make it on the list. The idea is to make a list of "connectors" and send them new gadgets and products to test. [Newsweek just did a story about this](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6852842/site/newsweek/). I think it is almost like an opt-in focus group. The obvious criticism would be these companies are trying to buy "buzz". The difference between this and some buzz creation companies is 1) it's not stealth 2) they don't tell you what to say. I checked with Auren and he says that we can write whatever we want about the products. When I get a product from Silicon Valley 100, I will state this clearly in any blog post that refers to it and will say what I think. I realize that the fact that we probably get to keep most of the products makes it a bit like bribery, but if it's crap, I'm sure most people will throw it away. I would be most interested in products that are still not on the market where our feedback could be incorporated in the product design. Then our feedback could be more constructive...

Anyway, I'd be curious on people's thoughts.

The first product is a [brondell high-tech toilet seat](http://www.brondell.com/). I told Auren, that this is one product that Japan is a world leader in. [I blogged this before](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/08/31/washlets_hit_50_penetration.html), but we have over 50% household penetration. The one in my house and in my office even has anti-stinky gas-gate like air filtration.

UPDATE: Just uploaded [a 5 min 4.3 MB conversation](http://joi.ito.com/sounds/aurenjoi.mp3) with Auren Hoffman, the founder of the Silicon Valley 100.

UPDATE 2: [Uploaded it to archive.org too](http://www.archive.org/audio/audio-details-db.php?collection=opensource_audio&collectionid=aurenjoi). Maybe I should put my media files there instead since archive org does the file conversions for me too...
