[Eric](http://www.erichaller.com/) and I were chatting about how cool Garage Band was and we decided to try collaboration over the Internet. I grabbed some samples off of a [talk Lawrence Lessig gave in Helsinki](http://www.aula.cc/users/viewarticle.php?articleid=260), laid down some beats and "started the car". The I passed it over to Eric. Eric laid down some more tracks, added effects, mixed it and sent it back to me. I added some metadata and [posted it to archive.org (being processed now)](http://www.archive.org/audio/audio-details-db.php?collection=opensource_audio&collectionid=startingthecar) and "[Permission Granted](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/?Permission_Granted)" was born.

We just figured this out a few minutes ago, but I think Permission Granted will be a collaboration between Eric and me. We're "co-pilots". We'll mess around putting samples from talks and discussions to music. We're still sort of not-stupid-enough-to-be-funny, but not-good-enough-to-be-cool, but hopefully we'll the the hang of it soon.
