All I wanted to do was forward my telephone calls. I decided to dive into [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/). I realized that all of the "easy configure" setups were limited for my purposes. Then I realized I should probably get my head around what Asterisk is actually doing and play with Linux. Before I knew it, the folks on [#joiito](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/?ircchannel) had convinced me to install [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntulinux.org/) Linux. I finally routed my first call from my bottom-up install of Asterisk.

What a [Yak shave](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/03/05/yak_shaving.html).

So... what's the best laptop for running Linux?
