One hour left of my [Connexion](http://www.connexionbyboeing.com/) service. I was using my PHS and Narita Airport wifi before I boarded the flight and they were both slower than this connexion service aboard this flight. I have a feeling Frankfurt airport will be about the same, but it will be more expensive. (I only paid $30 for 12 hours of access on this flight.) I'm on my way to [Menorca](http://joi.typepad.com/photos/menorca2002/) for a friend's wedding, where the last time I was there, even [GSM was spotty](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/09/17/setting_up_gprs_on_menorca.html). Anyway, gprs roaming, as [I found out awhile ago](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/02/27/grps_roaming_works_technically.html), is ridiculously expensive. Connectivity, at least for this trip, will be better in the air than on the ground... It's a very strange feeling to think, "I can't wait for my flight where my connectivity will be good and cheap." ;-)

UPDATE: [Here is a list of airlines and flights that offer the service](http://www.connexionbyboeing.com/index.cfm?p=cbb.serviceavailable&l=en.US&ec=&e=). Quite impressive.
