Anyone who is tuning in right now... about 2 hours ago a series of explosions were reported in London involving the Underground and a bus. The [BBC reports](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4659093.stm) "Large numbers of casualties have been reported after at least six explosions on the Underground network and a double-decker bus in London."

UPDATE: Most big media sites are slow or down. You can get to many of the blogs post via Technorati for queries such as "[London explosions](http://www.technorati.com/search/london%20explosions)". Lots of pictures on the [Flickr London Explosions Group](http://www-us.flickr.com/groups/londonexplosions/) / [Flickr Bomb tag](http://flickr.com/photos/tags/bomb/). [Wikinews article](http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Explosions%2C_%27serious_incidents%27_occuring_across_London). (Note: I think Wikinews has had the fastest and most substantive news so far. Good job folks.)

We're having a real-time global discussion on [#joiito on Freenode](http://irc://irc.freenode.net/#joiito) if you want to join us.

UPDATE 7/7/2005 11:03 UTC: Blair says G8 will continue.

I notice that the Japanese news has just started picking this up. I just remembered that I was listening to a Japanese radio station just about when this was happening. They were reporting about how GW Bush ran into a policeman on his bike and fell over and was saved from injury by his red helmet. Doh.

UPDATE 7/7/2005 11:08 UTC:
> jbond - heard on radio4. "sources who follow Al Qaida, are saying it's likely they were involved"

UPDATE 7/7/2005 11:32 UTC:
> [11:32] felix - we are jammed in between aldgate station and whitechapel hospital it's a bit like a war zone  
> [11:32] felix - RJ and mischa live right above aldgate station they are not allowed to leave the house  
> [11:33] felix - seems like the carefully crafted emergnecy plan works smoothly  
> [11:35] felix - like I said london is cool  
> [11:35] felix - everybody is really calm.  
> [11:36] felix - as the shut the whole public transport down  
> [11:37] felix - it's kinda weird how everything is so business as usual  
> [11:38] felix - I would have thought there would be more panic

UPDATE 7/7/2005 13:10 UTC: They have just closed the bathrooms on BART. (The California Bay Area Rapid Transit.)

UPDATE: Lots of good links on [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/07/07/photos_related_to_lo.html).

UPDATE: [Loic blogs about](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2005/07/john_gibson_fox.html) John Gibson from Fox News saying that he wished it had happened in Paris. Ugh.

UPDATE: [Julio points us](http://www.merodeando.com/en/archives/2005/07/08-gibson-and-horovitz-two-misse.php) to David Horovitz writing "And now as then, one suspects, the response of the targeted nation will be resilience and a determined response, rather than capitulation. London is not Madrid." [in the Jerusalem Post](http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1120702710251).
