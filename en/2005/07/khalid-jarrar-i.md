> [Blogger Khalid Jarrar, author of [Secrets in Baghdad](http://secretsinbaghdad.blogspot.com/), remains in custody of the Iraqi intelligence service, known as the Mukhabarat.](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/globalvoices/2005/07/15/khalid-jarar-iraqi-blogger-detained/)
>
> As we [reported yesterday](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/globalvoices/2005/07/14/fortunately-its-a-nice-governmental-gang/), [Khalid’s brother Raed says](http://raedinthemiddle.blogspot.com/2005/07/fortunately-its-nice-governmental-gang.html) their family was relieved to hear on Thursday morning that Khalid is still alive after going missing for two days. On Sunday, [Khalid described on his blog](http://secretsinbaghdad.blogspot.com/2005/07/so_10.html) how his apartment in Baghdad had been broken into and his hard drive was stolen. Soon after that he disappeared.

> Khalid’s family are calling for his release, or at very least that he be charged and tried for something. Raed says: “Our goal now is to ask the mokhabarat to take Khalid to court and reveal what exactly he is being charged with (if anything).”

> The Committee to Protect Bloggers [supports the Jarrar family’s appeals](http://committeetoprotectbloggers.civiblog.org/blog/_archives/2005/7/15/1033627.html).

> Please show your support for the Khalid Jarrar by posting supportive comments at [Raed’s](http://raedinthemiddle.blogspot.com/2005/07/fortunately-its-nice-governmental-gang.html) and [Khalid’s](http://secretsinbaghdad.blogspot.com/2005/07/so_10.html) latest posts. If you’re a blogger, please help spread the word by linking to them.

At least they found out that it's only the secret service...

> If your child or sibling vanishes for two days then calls from the secret service jail in any other place on earth, that would be considered a disaster and a violation of human rights…

> In Iraq, however, it’s Happy News.

> Because the other options include: To be tortured, executed, and thrown in garbage by SCIRI and their Badr brigades. To be held by the Iraqi police and left to choke to death in one of their cars. To be held by the US troops then disappear and be mistreated for months in one of their many prisons. To be kidnapped by one of the countless criminal gangs and cost your family some tens of millions of Iraqi Dinars and/or your life.

I wish there were more that we could do than just hope Khalid makes it home safely...

Just a quick note... His mom says he is now free.
