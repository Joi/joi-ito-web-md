> The thought that popped into my head when I first saw this incredible photo was, "next time you feel smug or badass, remember this and say -- no you are not tough. *This* is tough."  [Pieter Hugo](http://www.pieterhugo.com/index.html)'s photo series "Hyena People of Nigeria" is the result of a ten-day trek the South African photographer took with a group of wandering minstrels and their animal companions: three hyenas, two pythons and four monkeys. Shown here: "Mallam Mantari Lamal with Mainasara, Nigeria, 2005"

> Here's a snip from [a "making of" interview](http://www.sanwild.org/NOTICEBOARD/news2005/The%20Beastie%20Boys.htm) with Hugo:
> > ‘Last year I saw a picture on a website that was taken from a car window in Nigeria,” says Pieter Hugo. “It showed a man with a hyena on the streets of Lagos.”
>
> Seated on a restaurant balcony overlooking Cape Town’s city bowl, the tall, athletic photographer says it was this crude photograph that motivated him to visit Nigeria. “The caption said he was a debt collector,” he continues, a glass of wine and salad placed in front of him. “The photograph really intrigued me.”
>
> Through a local researcher Hugo was introduced to Adetokunbo Abiola, a Nigerian journalist who emailed him to say he knew of the men (there were more than one) in the picture. A few weeks later Hugo nervously exited Lagos airport on his first visit to the country."

Previously on Boing Boing: [Hyenas and baboons for pets](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/03/27/hyenas_and_baboons_f.html) [I remember linking to a picture of these Hyenas last year](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/07/21/its_just_a_lost_pet_hyena.html). The picture was amazing, but honestly, it didn't motivate me to visit Nigeria. I'm glad it motivated Hugo though.
