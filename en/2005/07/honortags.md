[Dan Gillmor](http://bayosphere.com/blog/dangillmor) and crew have announced [HonorTags](http://honortags.com/). This builds on his [citizen journalists pledge](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/06/22/bayosphere_citizen_journalism_pledge.html), but is basically a way to tag posts to describe context and role of the author. Currently they have: HonorTagJournalism, HonorTagProfessional, HonorTagAdvocate, HonorTagPersonal, HonorTagFiction, HonorTagUnTag. They are soliciting feedback. Maybe I should suggest HonorTagJoker.
