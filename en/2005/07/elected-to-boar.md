I was recently elected to the board of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility ([CPSR](http://www.cpsr.org/)). I had been a member for quite awhile and have been the Treasurer of the Japan chapter [since we started it in 2002](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2002/06/20/cpsr_japan_chapter_formed.html). CPSR has thousands of members and has incubated a number of important projects including the Electronic Privacy Information Center ([EPIC](http://www.epic.org/)). I hope that I can help CPSR mobilize more members for what I believe is a very important mandate that CPSR has. I'll keep you all posted on the activities, but take a look at the web page if you are interested in getting involved.
