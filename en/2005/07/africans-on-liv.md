[Ethan Zuckerman](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/) has posted roundups on Africans talking about Live 8 [here](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/globalvoices/?p=263) and [here](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/globalvoices/?p=270) and [blogs about it himself](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/?p=98). Please do read these. They are an important voice.

Ethan is clearly weary and skeptical as are many of the Africans. I can understand this. However, I think Live 8 is a good thing. Although the concert may not have the effect on the G8 meeting that some people hope it will, I think that the concern will reach a broad audience and increase awareness. We should not forget how few people even realize there is a problem in Africa. I understand the arguments about nuances and stereotyping. They are valid. But I believe the benefits outweigh the costs in such an effort to "get the word out". The average person won't get the nuance. Not yet at least.

Also, I don't think it's fair to slam people for having fun or for the promoters for trying to add to their career. I think it's all part of getting things like this to happen. If you read any of the books or diaries of leaders of the various political movements and protests in the 60's, most of them were having a lot of fun. That didn't make the movements less effective or relevant.
