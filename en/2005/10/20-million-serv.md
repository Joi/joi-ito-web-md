> Technorati passed 20 million blogs today. The 20 millionth was [Les CE2/CM2 Anquetil](http://anquetil.canalblog.com/), a blog from an elementary school in Reims, France, in the heart of Champagne country. They started the blog to celebrate running 2 miles in a Relay Marathon.

That's a lot of blogs. I wouldn't say "20 million can't be wrong" (because history tells us otherwise) but blogging is clearly more of a trend now than a "fad".
