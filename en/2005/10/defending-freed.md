[Good post on Global Voices](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/globalvoices/2005/10/10/india-defending-freedom-of-speech/) describing how Gaurav Sabnis made comments about an educational institution and receives threats to sue him for 30 billion rupees (45 rupees to a USD). Gaurav leave IBM but sticks behind his words and fights for his freedom of speech. This is an important issue where, as the GV post points out, the USP of the country is its open democracy.

It reminds me a bit of my [sms.ac incident](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/02/22/letter_from_kevin_b_jones_of_smsac.html)...
