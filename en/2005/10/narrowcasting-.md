Inevitable with the narrow-casting of magazines that [Germany now has a magazine about divorce.](http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/09/yourmoney/mag10.php)

Reminds me of the launch of a [magazine in the US for gay parents](http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20F14FF3E5E0C708EDDAD0894DC404482). (Apologies for this being a Times Select link.)

These magazines, [Rosenkrieg](http://www.rosenkrieg-magazin.de/) along with [And Baby](http://www.andbabymag.com/) magazine, show how publishers often miss obvious socioeconomic groups due to prejudices or oversight.

Both gay parents and divorcing couples are willing to pay large sums of money for information relating to their situation and there are many advertisers keen to hit those demographics. For years, however, no magazines addressed those issues.

Be interesting to compare the categories of popular Blogsites with the available publications to see where the low barriers to entry of Blogs has discovered a demographic ripe for a glossy publication.

This once again shows the strength of interacting with consumers (readers) during conception of a project.
