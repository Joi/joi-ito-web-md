> [2005 CPSR Annual Meeting & Norbert Wiener Award Reception](http://www.cpsr.org/act/events/annconf/annconf05)

Saturday, October 29

All Saints Episcopal Church  
555 Waverley Street (between University and Hamilton)  
Palo Alto, CA, USA

**Membership Meeting**

11:00 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. and 2:00 p.m.- 5:30 p.m.

The Meeting is an opportunity for members to meet with the Board and a newly formed [Advisory Council](http://www.cpsr.org/board/ac), face-to-face, for an extended discussion focusing intensively on the state of CPSR and a Strategic Plan. The Board wants members to be involved in planning our future direction and prospects. By the way, at a Members' Meeting, The CPSR ByLaws state that, "Ten percent (10%) of the members shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at a meeting of the members." We will announce special steps to facilitate that conversation. For now, please save the date.

To join CPSR, renew your lapsed membership in CPSR, or register to attend as a current member in good standing, use [http:cpsr.org/membershipForm](http://http:cpsr.org/membershipForm)
