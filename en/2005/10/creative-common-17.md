Creative Commons (CC) has traditionally been supported by a small number of foundations which have very generously allowed CC to get started and grow into an international movement. (Thanks!) CC is now entering its second phase where it must begin to be supported by the public itself. This is an important step and is also required by the tax authorities in the US for CC to retain its nonprofit status.

[Larry has written something about the fund raising as well as an update on CC over on the CC site.](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5661) Please take a look at it and send your [donation to the CC fundraising campaign](http://creativecommons.org/support/)! Thanks in advance.
