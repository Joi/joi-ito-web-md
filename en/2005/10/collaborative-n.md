Tech editor of the [International Herald Tribune](http://www.iht.com) seems open to publishing a column of blog-generated ideas.

I need topics of interest our newspaper's readers (wealthy global audience of frequent travelers with diverse interests in politics, economic and culture).

Conversations on this blog that might work have included my postings on [Global Sociology of Online Shopping](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/10/19/sociology_of_online_shoppers_worldwide.html#comments) or Joi's post on ideas for new [inflight software](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/10/19/united_flight_map_software.html#comments).

Input welcome on:

**Layout** - should it be in blog-style or reworked into a newspaper format. I tend to prefer reworking it, but my editor liked the idea of experimenting with a new formatting that might resemble an online chat.

**Topics** - Ideas for topics that would get the best response and interest our readers. I prefer things that are less about tech-issues than about ideas that may relate to technology.

**Writing form** - should it be written from a blog or could it be compiled on a wiki-style platform? This would require me to lay out the format and ask for people to help filling it in, but if someone has some appropriate social software platform, it might be fun to test the concept.

**Online communities** - A futher thought on the above concept is that it may be fun to involve specific online communities in writing guest columns. This would mean asking for the communities - [friendster](http://www.friendster.com), [asmallworld](http://www.asmallworld.net), [openbc](https://www.openbc.com/) or another one. The idea would best to use a community with a particular purpose or outlook rather than a generic one. That would allow us to explore how these communities are different. Anyone senior enough at one of these communities should feel free to get in touch.
