> [U.S. soldiers videotaped desecrating Taliban corpses.](http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/film-rolls-as-troops-burn-dead/2005/10/18/1129401256154.html) The bodies were positioned to face Mecca and burned -- an act of desecration that violates Islamic burial rites and the Geneva Conventions. A U.S. PsyOps specialist [broadcast an inflammatory message](http://news.sbs.com.au/dateline/index.php?page=transcript&dte=2005-10-19&headlineid=1036) to the nearby town in order to incite an attack. *"Attention, Taliban, you are all cowardly dogs. You allowed your fighters to be laid down facing west and burned. You are too scared to come down and retrieve their bodies. This just proves you are the lady boys we always believed you to be."*

I'm just re-blogging this in case you haven't seen it yet. I don't have much to add at this point.
