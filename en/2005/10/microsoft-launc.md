At [EuroOSCON](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/euroscon/), Microsoft announced new software licenses including some variations that may meet the [Open Source Initiative (OSI)](http://www.opensource.org/) [Open Source Definition](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php). This is great news. Most of the OSI board members are at EuroOSCON (unfortunately, I'm in LA and missed EuroOSCON) and I hope they have some good meetings with the Microsoft folks. I look forward to seeing their licenses submitted to [OSI license-discuss](http://www.opensource.org/docs/certification_mark.php#approval) so that OSI and the community can give them feedback on the licenses.

See [Tim O'Reilly](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/10/new_source_licenses_from_micro.html) and [Danese Cooper](http://danesecooper.blogs.com/divablog/2005/10/simon_phipps_eu.html)'s blog posts for more information.
