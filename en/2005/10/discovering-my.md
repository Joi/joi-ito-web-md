I guess there's something about online games and the [Year of the Rooster](http://www.c-c-c.org/chineseculture/zodiac/Rooster.htm). I just remembered that the [first post of this blog](http://joi.ito.com/archives/1993/07/01/howard_mentioned_me_in_wired.html) is a link to an article that Howard Rheingold [wrote about my addiction to Multi-User Dungeons (MUD) back in 1993 in Wired Magazine](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.03/muds.html?pg=4&topic=). (The post is dated the publish date of the magazine article, not the date the post was written. This post dates back to before my blog when I organized various links on my web site.) Groundhog Day! It's 2005 and [I'm doing the same thing](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?world_of_warcraft). Eek.

I remember that trying to get onto the MUD server at Essex University was what got me to learn X.25. (A little more than KDD wanted people to know.) It was the people who I met on the MUD that got me an account on the University computer where I was first able to access APRANet. I learned more about computers from other players in MUD than anywhere else during my high school days.

I wonder what I'm learning playing World of Warcraft...
