![Snapshot 002-1](http://joi.ito.com/Snapshot_002-1.jpg)

Thanks to Philip and Beth, I've purchased a plot of land in [Second Life](http://secondlife.com/) next to the [MAKE](http://make.oreilly.com/) plot (<secondlife://Crescent/13/99>) for [#joiito members](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?ircchannel) to hang out. (Nice neighborhood.) Feel free to drop by and mess around. You can join the #joiito group by searching for #joiito or "joi" in groups. The land is also listed. The SL URL for the plot is: <secondlife://Crescent/29/86>
