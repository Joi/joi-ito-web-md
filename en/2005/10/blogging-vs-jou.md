**Posting by Thomas Crampton**

Time for some reflection after more than a month of blogging here courtesy of Joi.

For my part, I have found Blogs are different from journalism because:

**Involvement**: In blogging you engage and try to spark conversations, not lecture. You succeed by getting feedback, not by writing something conclusive. A successful posting is a work in progress.

**Timing**: Not so important as I thought it would be. When I blog about a news article that I wrote three days earlier, the conversation takes off as if it were new. In that way, Blogs are more like a cocktail party conversation.

**Tone**: Blogs are more informal and personal. You are forced the kind of self-references that most news organizations try to beat out of journalists from birth.

**Opinions**: Blog postings work best with strong opinions in them. This is problematic for a journalist because we are supposed to avoid that. You can often get the same effect, however, by asking sharp questions.

**Length**: Postings are never longer than a few paragraphs and often broken into bullet point style (like this posting)

**Reporting**: I have not yet done any primary reporting in order to write a Blog posting. The most I do is look up things on the web and riff off knowledge or experience I already have.

**Simple and quick**: Blogging takes far less time than I expected. Since it is asynchronous communication, you can log on once or twice a day or take part more actively. Very much enjoy checking in with old postings to see how the conversation has evolved.

These thoughts came yesterday in London while participating at a conference organized by [Accountability](http://www.accountability.org.uk/) on a panel hosted by [Michel Ogrizek](http://www.edelman.com/news/ShowOne.asp?ID=65), vice chairman of Edelman, the other panelists were [David Weinberger](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger) of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School and [John Lloyd](http://search.ft.com/search/totalSearch_Form.html?vsc_appId=ts&symb=&ftsite=FTCOM&searchtype=equity&vsc_query=john+lloyd&x=0&y=0&searchOption=news) of the Financial Times.

The audience and other panelists raised many great points - some of which I have plaguarized above - and we could only conclude that the interface between Blogs and journalism is a hot zone that will be fun to watch.

Additions and critiques to this list welcomed!
