Interesting venture launching in a few weeks by a group of Mainstream Media journalists in a blog. It is called [Pajama's Media](http://pajamasmedia.com/) and has contributors from a number of mainstream outlets.

I think a cooperative blog is a good model - [www.boingboing.net](http://boingboing.net/) style - and would like to explore those possibilities myself. Seems to me the key is finding the right mix of people and then letting them loose.

My company - the [International Herald Tribune](http://www.iht.com/) and [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/) - is not moving into the blog sphere as quickly as I would advocate.

That said, some colleagues are blogging on their own: [Howard French](http://www.howardwfrench.com/) in Shanghai, for example. Don't know of others.
