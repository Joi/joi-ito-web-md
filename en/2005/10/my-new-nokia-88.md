![8800-1](http://joi.ito.com/8800-1.jpg)

Yesterday [Marko](http://ahtisaari.typepad.com/) brought me a [Nokia 8800](http://www.nokia8800.com/). [I wrote about this phone when it came out](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/04/07/nokia_announces_ryuichi_sakamoto_phone.html). It has special meaning for me because the sounds were designed by my friend [Ryuichi Sakamoto](http://www.sitesakamoto.com/). I'm also proud to have introduced Marko and Nokia to Ryuichi. I had read the reviews, but after playing with the phone I'm extremely excited by how cool it is.

The design is beautiful and the attention to detail is stunning. Everything from the black box with the steel clasp that it comes in to the pulsating blue light at the base of the charging dock to the extra battery and extra battery charger on the dock to the polished steel makes it feel very special. I think it has something to do with the steel, but it doesn't have that cheap plastic feel that most mobile phones have. When you slide the phone open, it is a metal on metal sound/feel, which is a "real" version of the metallic "schwing" sound that some of the Sony phones play when you open them. It's also just the right weight and size for my taste.

Ryuichi did a great job with the sounds and makes this the first phone where I actually enjoy listening to the various ring tones. Congratulations to everyone involved. Excellent job. The only problem is that it doesn't sync with my Mac and doesn't have UMTS so I can't use it in Japan... but when I'm in any country where I can use GSM I'll be using this phone.
