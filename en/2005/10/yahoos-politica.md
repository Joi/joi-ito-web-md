Three questions regarding the [Committee to Protect Journalists](http://www.cpj.org/) today naming online journalist [Shi Tao as a winner of the International Press Freedom Award](http://www.cpj.org/awards05/awards_release_05.html).

His 10-year sentence to a Chinese prison came partly due to a [disclosure about him by Yahoo!.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4221538.stm)

1- Do employees of Yahoo! feel responsible for/comfortable with this man going to prison? (Will they, for example, send care packages or join a letter-writing campaign petitioning the government of China for his release?)

2- How do users of Yahoo! feel about the company's  [privacy policies](http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/all.html)? (Or privacy policies of other Internet companies, for that matter.)

3- As a journalist who has had [many police encounters in countries with nasty authoritarian dictatorships](http://www.iht.com/articles/2001/07/17/edtom_ed2__0.php), I am always very concerned about the safety of those with whom I interact. Does online interaction lead to a sense of diminished responsibility? Do we need to see someone's face or visit their family at home to feel their pain?
