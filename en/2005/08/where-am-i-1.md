Plazes has a cool new feature called "Where is". So you can see "[Where is Joi Ito?](http://beta.plazes.com/whereis/JoiIto/365)". It relies on Google maps which is a bit sketchy with addresses for Japan, but otherwise it seems to work quite well. On the other hand, it doesn't show the routing as well as the [old map using IndyJunior](http://joi.ito.com/plazes/).
