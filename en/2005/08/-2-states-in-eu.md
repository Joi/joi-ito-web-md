Had to crank out a story on tight deadline about digital music rights in Europe: [2 states in EU ease sales of songs over Internet](http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/08/17/business/royalties.php)

Selling music online in Europe could currently require an online music operater to get up to 25 licenses (one from each country) in order to operate, a situation Brussels seems strongly bent on changing: Collecting agencies in other European Union member states could face fines of up to 10 percent of their total revenue if they fail to open up in a similar manner, the official said.

Interesting to see the EU is tackling hurdles to running a digital business. Are they doing enough?
