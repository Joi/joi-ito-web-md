[Wrote an article on the Smallworld website.](http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/08/28/business/net29.php)

Idea behind the site is that there is a group of interconnected people around the world who have similar interests, concerns and problems. These people are wealthy, well-traveled and well-educated. They smallworld is the invitation-only community for these people.

Could gated communities grow more common on the Internet?

Counterintuitive for an open medium, but it does allow creation of self-selected target groups for advertisers, kind of like luxury magazines. Could almost be seen as the next generation of online publication.

UPDATE: [Xeni's Wired article on ASW](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/posts.html?pg=2).
