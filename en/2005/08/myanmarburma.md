[I wrote a story on the Global fund deciding to pull out of Myanmar on Friday.](http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/08/22/asia/myanmar.php)

The fund fights HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB, diseases that are the scourges of many developing nations. [Click here for their press release](http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/media_center/press/pr_050819.asp).

The fund had been criticised by some for going into the country (some feared they could be seen as providing a support for the goverment) and they were also criticized for pulling out (they did not try hard enough).

Who is correct?

BREAKING NEWS: Rumor is that general Maung Aye has ousted general Than Shwe. If true, we may see even more hardline actions by the government. Maung Aye already beat out general Than Shwe (considered one of the more open members of the ruling clique). now Maung Aye may have consolidated his power further.

In sum: Factions have long weakened Myanmar's military regime, but one of the tougher generals now appears to be consolidating power.

Anyone else have thoughts on Maung Aye?
