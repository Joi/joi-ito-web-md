[SocialText](http://www.socialtext.com/) just developed [Wikiwyg](http://demo.wikiwyg.net/wikiwyg/demo/standalone/). A way to edit a wiki by double-clicking on a section and just editing it directly. The code is open source and they are working on getting it working with other wiki systems. Currently it only works in [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/).
