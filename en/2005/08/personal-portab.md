My sister, the smarter half of the Ito family duo is an expert on Japanese youth culture and mobile culture. Her book just came out from MIT Press. I've been running around in a scatterbrained fashion all my life trying to reach into academia. She has been immersed in academic rigor but has been reaching out to the public from the inside. Recently, we've begun to cross paths more and more. This book is another step in bridging our worlds.

Anyway, I'm totally biased and very proud of my sister, but you should still take my recommendation and buy this book. ;-) (Or at least download the introduction.)

The book I edited with Daisuke Okabe and Misa Matsuda is out from MIT Press and [available on amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&camp=1789&tag=chanponorg&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/0262090392/qid=1123623416/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1?v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846). Click [here](http://www.itofisher.com/mito/archives/pppintro.pdf) for a pdf of a draft of the introduction.

The book is an edited collection of social and cultural studies of keitai (mobile phone) and pager use over the past decade or so in Japan. We included our own research as well as research by a variety of mostly Japanese scholars whose work we translated from Japanese.
