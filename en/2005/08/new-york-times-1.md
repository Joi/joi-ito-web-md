[Markoff at the New York Times broke the embargo and scooped the Mozilla announcement](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/03/technology/03browse.html?ex=1280721600&en=5a70f4ba27e035d6&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss). Markoff got a few things wrong which maybe weren't clear.

The announcement is about a subsidiary that the Mozilla Foundation is creating. He says it is a "for-profit" sub-sidiary, which I think could be misunderstood. It is a 100% subsidiary of the Foundation which is non-profit with non-profit goals. The subsidiary is a taxable entity, but has primarily the same mission as the foundation.

Also, he refers to the subsidiary "offering service and support at a fee." This is not true. You can imagine the value that the search traffic alone has. At the moment, the subsidiary is not considering offering service and support for a fee.

There is an embargo, although this scoop may have breached the dam. I'm about to leave for the aiport to go to OSCON so I don't know when I can update you again, but I'll blog more about this and my role in all of this after the embargo is officially lifted.

UPDATE: I am now on the board of the Mozilla Foundation, the parent of the new subsidiary. The [reorg announcement is on the Mozilla site now](http://www.mozilla.org/reorganization/). More later.

UPDATE 2: I appears that the time zone of the embargo was not clear or was lost somewhere along the chain and Markoff didn't intentionally break the embargo.

UPDATE 3: The [official press release](http://www.mozilla.org/press/mozilla-2005-08-03.html). [Chris Blizzard](http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/html/2005/08/index.shtml#200508032005) and [Tristan Nitot](http://standblog.org/blog/2005/08/03/93114287-mozilla-foundation-reorganization) blog about the reorg.
