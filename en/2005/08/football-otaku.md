> Michele loves her football something fierce. Over the years it's gotten worse, growing from watching the occasional Sunday game with Cincinatti (her hometown team) to watching Thursday Night Football to this year with her enrollment into fantasy football in July.

> Last year for her birthday I bought her a [special quilting table](http://www.hornofamerica.com/products.cfm?cat=quilting&func=view&pID=82) and she had it placed in the living room so she could quilt while watching football.

> For the Superbowl this year, we bought an HDTV so the game could be as good as possible. Now we have the [NFL Network](http://www.nfl.com/nflnetwork/home), the [DirecTV NFL Sunday Ticket](http://directvsports.com/Subscriptions/NFLSundayTicket/), and even the [DirecTV Superfan package](http://directvsports.com/Subscriptions/NFLSundayTicket/SuperFan/) for true football otaku that need to watch EIGHT football games SIMULTANEOUSLY.

This is why I should not be designing media products for the American market. I would never have imagined that something like this.
