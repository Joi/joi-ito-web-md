Fireworks, or *hanabi* are a hugely popular and very important part of Japanese summer. People get dressed up in traditional Japanese *yukata* and makes their way with thousands of other people to see hanabi. Magazines and web portals dedicate large sections for information on hanabi, which you can find somewhere almost every weekend during the summer.

The Jingu hanabi show is a non-standard because it happens in the middle of Tokyo. (Most are over the beach, bays, lakes or in the countryside.) Jingu is the Tokyo baseball stadium and they pack the stadium with people and shoot fireworks almost right over the stadium. The fireworks are low, huge and loud. It is an immersive experience. That is combined with a stadium full of screaming people. Replace the traditional "oohs and ahhs" with "OMG OMG WTF" The streets and rooftops all around the stadium are full of people who are getting the benefit of the fireworks for "free". ([I wrote about the business model of fireworks last year.](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/08/08/fireworks_for_free.html))

After these last few hot and humid days, the hanabi reminded me that there are at least a few things to look forward to in Japanese summer.
