I realized that I haven't made a new PGP key in a while. I just installed the new PGP and made a new key. I've signed it with all of the old keys that I can remember the passwords for and revoked the second to the oldest one. The most recent one still works, but please switch to this one as soon as you can.

Here is the public key: [joi.asc](http://joi.ito.com/joi.asc) and here is the fingerprint: B652 199B 6996 219B 62AE 6364 E349 8387 783D 4E0A

I keep wondering if I should make expiring keys, but it seems like it would be inconvenient as well. What do you all do?
