I'm in New Delhi airport on my way back to Japan. It will be nice to be home but unfortunately, I'm only going to be home for three nights and then I'm off again to Taiwan... I'm sorry to miss the Holi Day today where people throw paint colored water at each other, but I need to get home. New Delhi was excellent. Thanks again. India's an amazing place. I must come back.
