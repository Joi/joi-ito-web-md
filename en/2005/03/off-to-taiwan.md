I'm off to Taiwan today. Tonight I'm giving a talk at the [TW Blogger BoF](http://blog2005.twnic.net.tw/) and tomorrow morning I'm giving a talk at the [TWNIC](http://www.twnic.net.tw/English/Index.htm) Annual Seminar. I haven't been to Taiwan for over 20 years so I'm looking forward to visiting, albeit briefly.

UPDATE: Video of Jedi, the father of Taiwan blogs. ([312K .3gp](http://joi.ito.com/images/jedi.3gp) taken with my Nokia 7610) I have no idea what he is saying.

UDPATE 2: They gave away 3 1G iPod Shuffles at the end. No wonder so many people showed to the talk. Maybe I should make it a condition of future speaking engagements. I'll speak if you give way 3 iPod shuffles at the end of my talk. ;-)
