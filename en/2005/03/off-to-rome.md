Thanks to everyone in Madrid for all of the hospitality and excellent company.

I'm off today to Rome. See you on the other side.

UPDATE: Just arrived in Rome. I had asked for a hotel with Internet. I realized when I arrived at the Hotel Hassler that I had stayed here once before with my mother and sister around 20 years or so ago. I remember it being an excellent hotel. However, I remember that they didn't take credit cards back then. Now they have Internet. I remember this was my late mother's favorite hotel in Rome...
