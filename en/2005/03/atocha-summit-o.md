I just heard some excellent comments by Kumi Naidoo on a panel. I was going to blog them, but I'm sitting next to Rebecca MacKinnon and I looked over her shoulder and noticed that she's taking better notes and is about to post something so I'll [link to her](http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/2005/03/kumi_naidoo_.html) instead.
