Long trip ahead. I'm off to Mar del Plata, Argentina today for the [ICANN meeting](http://www.icann.org/meetings/mardelplata/). It's a long trip involving flying from Tokyo to Chicago San Francisco, Washington DC, Buenos Aries, then meeting some people there and taking a car for 400 km or so...

UPDATE: I picked the fastish looking line coming through immigration out of Tokyo. The extremely efficient agent looked familiar and I confirmed from her stamp that she was agent 1128 that I had when I was departing in January as well. Kudos agent 1128.
