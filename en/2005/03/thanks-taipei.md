I was in Taiwan for one day and am at the airport on my way back to Tokyo now. Even though the bloggers at the bloggers meeting probably came mostly for the iPod Shuffle give-away, it was a great turnout and it was a treat to meet the vibrant Taiwan bloggers community. The talk the next day to the somewhat more sober, but venerable TWNIC audience was also interesting. It was great to meet Paul Wilson from APNIC and listen to John Klensin who was almost as convincing on video as he is in real life.

Special thanks to Ching Chiao for organizing a wonderful trip and the excellent meals. Taiwan is right up there with Italy now in my "best food overall" category.
