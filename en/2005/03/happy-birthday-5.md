> Mako sez, "Unhappy Birthday is a website/project commenting on the fact that the song "Happy Birthday To You" is under an actively enforced copyright held by Time Warner. The site offers tools and information to report unauthorized public performances of that work. If educating people and upholding the principle of copyright means risking a DoS of ASCAP's licensing enforcement infrastructure, that's a risk I'm willing to take."

I didn't realize I was engaging in copyright infringement when I sang *Happy Birthday* in public without paying. Better stop doing that and rat out anyone else who sings it without paying.
