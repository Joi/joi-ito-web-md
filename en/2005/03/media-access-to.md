[The International Summit on Democracy, Terrorism and Security](http://english.safe-democracy.org/) organizers have restricted press access. The press are restricted to a separate area and don't have access directly to the conference. This is one case where bloggers are lucky not to be considered "press". Having said that, I think they should give the press access to this conference. I guess they can join the IRC channel or read our blogs...

Unfortunately, I'm too busy participating to be blogging it well right now. I hope SOMEONE is blogging this.

David Weinberger: As Jon Stewart would say, "Washington Post - You read it here 12th."

UPDATE: I appears that too many press were invited and the couldn't all fit. It appears that the root of the problem is a logistical one rather than restriction for the sake of it...

Our workshop on Friday is supposed to be broadcast live on CNN. I'll post more details when I have them.
