Just started packing and charging up my gadgets for a longish trip ahead. I'm leaving tomorrow to participate in the [International Summit on Democracy, Terrorism and Security](http://english.safe-democracy.org/) and the [Atocha Workshop](http://www.atochaworkshop.org/) in Madrid. Then I'm going to Rome to give a talk there in a few places. After that I'm going to Milan to give a talk at the Università Milano Bicocca and attend the press conference to launch the 2005 edition of IBTS. Then I'm going to Amsterdam to give a keynote at the [Creative Capital Conference](http://www.creativecapital.nl/programme.php) and meet with the iCommons folks. Finally, I'm going to New Delhi to attend and speak at [Doors of Perception 8](http://doors8delhi.doorsofperception.com/). Then I'm back in Japan for one day to give a talk at the Internet Advertisers Association and off again the next day to Taiwan and other places... People have complained about my contribution to global warming through the jet fuel exhaust I help emit into the atmosphere. I think the first six months of this year will be the most pollutive that I can remember. I just noticed that between now and May, I will be on every single continent except Antarctica at least once.

Singing... *It's a small world after all. It's a small world after all.*
