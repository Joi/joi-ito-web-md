I recently agreed to be an advisor to [Civiblog](http://www.civiblog.org/index.html), a project to give free blogs to people working on global civil society. This ties in well with [Global Voices](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/globalvoices/). The project is run by [Citizen Lab](http://www.citizenlab.org/) (home of the infamous [Catspaw](http://insanecats.com/)) and is sponsored by [Tucows](http://www.tucows.com/) and the [Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation](http://www.gordonfn.org/).
> Welcome to Civiblog, a one-stop-site for global civil society. Canadian to the core — ever-devoted to peacekeeping and “globalist” foreign policies — it is our aim to showcase all communiqué in the sector, at home and abroad, onsite and by way of links and RSS syndication to partner sites. We are tapping into two explosive movements at once: 1) the growth of the citizen sector and 2) blogging, which is an increasingly popular tool with the potential to empower citizens the world over, one post at a time.

The site just launched and still needs some tweaking so feedback would be appreciated. Obviously using [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/) to show popular posts and breaking news on the top page and making blogs easier to find is on the agenda.
