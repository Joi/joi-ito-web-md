> Late last night, Yahoo! launched a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org) [search engine](http://search.yahoo.com/cc), permitting you to search the web, filtering results on the basis of Creative Commons licenses. So, as I feel like I've said 10,000 times when explaining CC on the road, "Show me pictures of the Empire State Building that I can use for noncommercial use," and [this](http://www.telescreen.org/esb/) is the first of about 13,000 on the list.

Excellent news. So who's next? Google? Nokia? Apple? Come on folks... ;-) Hardware, software and services that support Creative Commons is key for creating the sharing economy. Creative Commons was designed to enable machine readable encoding and this is a great example of why. Congrats to all who worked to make this happen.

[Update from Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/03/24/creative_commons_sea.html): DeWitt sez, "I added a [Creative Commons search](http://a9.com/cory%20doctorow?a=oB0007WF664) as one of the very first columns on A9 during our launch of OpenSearch last week at ETech."
