Decided to play a bit more [World of Warcraft](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?world_of_warcraft) this weekend. Wandering around Darkshire, I met the first person so far with a sense of humor. (Also the first person over 30 who I don't know in real life.) His name is Illuminus and he's a 37 year old philosopher/bouncer who likes to play mages. Anyway, we decided to start our own guild. It's called "[We Know](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?we_know)". If you're on Khadgar and want to join us, sign up on the wiki and look for me on Khadgar. We're still in the process of getting people to sign the charter.
