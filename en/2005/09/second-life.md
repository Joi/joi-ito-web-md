Inspired by Cory's talk at Accelerating Change, I've started [Second Life](http://secondlife.com/). (Someone described it to me as a home for retired Warcraft players. ;-P) My name there is... Joi Ito. I'm still pretty confused, but if you have a character there, please give me a holler or tell me something interesting to do. Thanks!

Update: [Philip just flickr'ed a photo he took when I visited him in Second Life.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pmtorrone/47910339/)
