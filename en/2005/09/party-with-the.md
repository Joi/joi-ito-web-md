North Korea, exaulted member of George W. Bush's axis of evil, just invited me to a festival, but I don't think I can make it.

I have, however, attended three previous Kim Jong Il birthday party.

Based on my experience, I can say that Pyongyang shows a declining level of party sense.

[The first I attended was the snazzy party at the Hong Kong jockey club in 2002](http://www.iht.com/articles/2002/02/21/a20_1.php)

[The pretty fancy birthday party in 2003](http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/02/17/norkor_6.php)

[And the distinctly downmarket event party in 2005 (terrible wine!)](http://www.iht.com/bin/print_ipub.php?file=/articles/2005/02/15/news/kim.php)

For the record, I crashed the party each time. The North Korean government didn't seem to like publicity about their luxury birthday parties while people were starved back at home.

Below is the invite to the festival in North Korea which includes 100,000 people in a synchronized dance!!
