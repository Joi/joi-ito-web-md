[Wrote a story in today’s paper about the new section of Charles de Gaulle airport being built for the A380, the world’s largest airliner.](http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/09/06/travel/trairport.php)

Turns out that the aircraft is so big that it requires a reconfiguration of terminal and in some ways it could be good. The second floor of the aircraft, for example, means that you can have two almost entirely separate sections. For people flying business and first class – not me! - they would walk into a separate part of the airplane that could have separate style of reception.

[The airport created a first-ever virtual visit of the new section for us to put on our website.](http://www.iht.com/multimedia/aeroport.20050901.html)

I wonder what other innovations could come of having such a large number of passengers in the sky? Massive online gaming within the aircraft?
