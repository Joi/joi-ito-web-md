I'm at the airport on my way to Hobart, Tasmania to give a talk at the AUC ["Evolution of the Species" conference](http://auc.uow.edu.au/index2.html?whatsnew.html~mainFrame).

My apologies to anyone who cares for not posting very much lately. My travel has been getting continuously more crazy. However, I will be grounded for two week after this trip to renew my passport and hope to get thoughts and other things organized.

Thanks a million to Thomas for picking up the slack on this somewhat neglected blog. I will admit that my (cough) research involving multi-user games online has also been taking up a little time.

Anyway, see you one the other side.
