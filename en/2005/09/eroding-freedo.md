> Over a third of the 100,000 students questioned felt the First Amendment went "too far" in guaranteeing freedom of speech, press, worship and assembly.

It's a bit scary when "normal" shifts like this.

Here is [an old Encyclopedia Britannica Films video clip](http://www.archive.org/stream/Despotis1946/Despotis1946_256kb.mp4) from 1946 (I think) about despotism that they showed to children in schools. Amazing how things have changed. I wonder what kids would think now watching this clip.
