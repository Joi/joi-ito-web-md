I'll be speaking at [Accelerating Change 2005](http://www.accelerating.org/ac2005/index.html) tomorrow and the day after.
> Artificial intelligence ("AI"), broadly defined, improves the intelligence and autonomy of our technology. Intelligence amplification ("IA") empowers human beings and their social, political, and economic environments. As in [previous years](http://www.accelerating.org/ac2004), a collection of today's most broad-minded, multidisciplinary, and practical change leaders will consider these twin trends from global, national, business, social, and personal foresight perspectives. Conference Brochure ([PDF, 6 pages](http://accelerating.org/ac2005/downloads/AC2005_Brochure.pdf)). One Sheet ([PDF](http://accelerating.org/ac2005/downloads/AC2005_OneSheet.pdf)).

If you're going, I'll see you there. It looks like they're sold out, but I'll try to blog some stuff. On the other hand, I'm notoriously bad at blogging conferences...

UPDATE: I showed up a bit late, but caught the tail end of the first day and also did a rant. Great audience and great program. Cory Ondrejka of Linden Lab talked about the positive benefits of video games. It was an excellent talk. It will be online later so I won't go into it here, but it was the first time I didn't feel guilty playing World of Warcraft while listening to a talk. ;-)
