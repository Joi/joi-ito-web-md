We just launched the [Technorati Live 8 site](http://live8.technorati.com/).
> [Technorati Live 8](http://live8.technorati.com/)
>
> Technorati has teamed up with Live 8 to bring you the latest conversations about the campaign to Make Poverty History. Read first hand accounts of the concerts and events, and get all the news and opinion from the blogosphere.

We've also put together some resources to help you find your way around Live 8 and the blog world:

The posts listed on the Technorati Live 8 site have been written by bloggers worldwide and appear in real time from Technorati's index of 1.1 million blogs. Find out [more about Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/about/). [Joe Trippi](http://www.joetrippi.com/) called us about two weeks ago with this idea. Thanks to a guest appearance of [Suw Charman](http://chocnvodka.blogware.com/) as the producer of the site and extra hard work by the Technorati team, we were able to get this site out in time.

This is such a good opportunity for nations like the United States and Japan to helped their damaged images and also show their solidarity to a cause that they shouldn't have to think twice about. I'm amazed at how poor the response of some of the developed nations has been to this call. Hopefully this concert and the voice of the blogs will help get their attention.
