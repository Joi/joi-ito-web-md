I've created a torrent using the Trackerless Auto setting on [BitTorrent](http://www.bittorrent.com/). It's a 37MB movie of my Roomba having some trouble with cliff detection and my dogs having trouble with the Roomba. It's probably not worth downloading, but if you feel like testing trackerless torrents, give it a try.

UPDATE: I've updated the torrent with the new version of the trackerless client. Can you give it a try?

UPDATE 2: I didn't have port forwarding on. I've turned it on now so it might work. However, I'll be on the road again in a few hours...
