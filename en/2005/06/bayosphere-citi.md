[Dan Gillmor](http://bayosphere.com/blog/dangillmor) has created a Citizen Journalist Pledge for contributors to [Bayosphere](http://bayosphere.com/).
> [Citizen Journalist Pledge](http://bayosphere.com/cjregister)

By submitting this form, **I agree to be accurate, complete, fair and transparent in my postings on Bayosphere. I will operate with integrity.**

I work in the community interest.

I report and produce news explaining the facts as fairly, thoroughly, accurately and openly as I can.

- Fair: I'm always listening to and taking account of other viewpoints;
- Thorough: I learn as much as I can in the time I have, and point to original sources when possible;
- Accurate: I get it right, checking my facts, correcting errors promptly and incorporating new information I learn from the community;
- Open: I explain my biases and conflicts, where appropriate.

I may also provide reviews (such as a critique of a movie or book) and commentary with a point of view based on facts, but I will have no significant financial or otherwise direct connection (membership, affiliation, close relationship, etc.) with an interested party.

If I do have such connections, I'll disclose them prominently, and my work may be labeled and/or categorized appropriately.

I agree, as an active member of this community, to help uphold the integrity of this pledge by challenging and reporting inappropriate postings or abuse.I think this is a reasonable pledge. One real difference between a citizen journalist and someone who isn't is whether they make such a pledge or at least agree to adhere to principles like this. I will also agree to a pledge.

One modification that I would have to make is conflict of interest disclosures. We've talked about this quite a bit on this blog. At one time, I started disclosing conflicts on every post, but people thought it sounded boastful. Lately, I try to make it clear by saying "we" or "I" when it is an organization that I am involved in, but assume that most people who read my blog understand my primary affiliations. Most of them are disclosed on [my wiki page](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/?joi_ito). Any new affiliation or minor affiliation to something I am writing about will be prominently disclosed.

The only other type of article that may not fit "citizen journalism" are posts where irony or some joke is the point of the post. I used to think that such material would be obvious, but I find that irony is often missed an taken seriously. I don't have a good solution for this.
