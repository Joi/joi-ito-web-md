I chose to be a mage on Warcraft. Mages are pretty cool, but they can only fight with one enemy at a time. They are useful in groups, but not good for playing alone. What's funny is that it's really hard for me to make friends on Warcraft. According to my sister, many people join Warcraft together and hang out with the real-life friends. Anyway, it's a humbling experience. I'm begging people to let me join their group and casting nice spells on people trying to earn their friendship.

If anyone has been considering starting World of Warcraft, please join Khadgar and be my friend. ;-)
