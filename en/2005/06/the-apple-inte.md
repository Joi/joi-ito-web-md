[Dvorak reports](http://www.dvorak.org/blog/?p=2133) that the leak about Apple switching from IBM PPC chips to Intel was leaked by someone at IBM to analysts who leaked it to CNet or someone close to CNet and then somehow the Wall Street Journal got the story. He wonders whether Apple was suing bloggers in anticipation of this announcement to try to plug the leaks. [Dan Gillmor wonders whether Apple is going to sue CNet](http://bayosphere.com/node/492).
