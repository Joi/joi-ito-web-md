*Nukazuke* is a type of Japanese traditional pickling that requires a special kind of mash that is made from rice husks and a number of other ingredients. This mash is called *nukamiso*. Some *nukamiso* is very old and it requires a special touch and constant mixing to maintain the special flavor. Vegetables are typically stuck in the *nukamiso* overnight or for the day.

[I wrote a Nukamiso guide was which I last updated in April 1999](http://joi.ito.com/archives/1999/04/04/nukamiso_guide_version_14.html). Since then, I have moved twice and in the process, killed my poor *nukamiso*. My original *nukamiso* seeded from three 50 year old *nukamiso*'s and a 25 year old *nukamiso*, two from Kyoto and two from Tokyo. Killing it was an unforgivable sin. Since then, Mizuka and I have felt so guilty, that it took a lot of courage to decide to start up again. The trigger was receiving a batch of the best eggplant *nukamiso* that I've ever had. The container contained a healthy amount of the *nukamiso* in addition to the eggplant and the instructions suggested that you could seed your *nukamiso* with this. We tried some vegetables from our garden and it was excellent, so we went and got a cedar tub today.

In the past, we lived in western houses so one of the challenges was keeping the *nukamiso* as cold as possible in the summer. This was partially the cause of the demise of our last *nukamiso*. This time, we now live in a traditional Japanese house has an opening to the space under the kitchen. Japanese houses typically store pickles and other things that need to stay cool in this space. Unlike doing *nukamiso* from purchased vegetables, we will be able to feed our nuka-chan with fresh home grown veggies.
