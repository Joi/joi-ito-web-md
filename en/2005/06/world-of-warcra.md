Sorry about the light blogging around here. I had to take a short-notice trip to the US and was away for awhile... but another major distraction has been [World of Warcraft](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/). Although I love video games, I had banned them from my life because I decided I didn't have time for them. However, I decided I needed to try one of the new multi-user games myself for \*cough\* research.

Anyway, I'm playing now if anyone wants to hook up. I'm on the North American World of Warcraft in the Khadgar realm. I'm a Gnome/Mage and my name is Vfd.
