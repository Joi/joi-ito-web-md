The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) is paying the Los Angeles police department to install cameras to crack down on DVD bootleggers. So far four cameras have been installed and six more are on the way. Although the LAPD refuses to say where the cameras are installed, but there is information on [Xeni's post on Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/06/07/hollywood_foots_bill.html). The post also contains funny details of their adventure.

I hadn't realized that there was DVD piracy activity in LA. I wonder how much "lost revenue" they will recoup from these cameras. I wonder what else the LAPD going to use these cameras for. Having said that, I think we probably have more cameras per square inch in Tokyo than in LA. Welcome to our world.

Xeni has [filed a story with Wired News](http://wired.com/news/privacy/0,1848,67768,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_3) about this as well.
