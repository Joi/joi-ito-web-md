[Chris Anderson has an interesting article about the massive parallel culture on the Internet](http://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2005/06/tribal_culture.html) in the context of the Long Tail. He posted [the picture Anil wearing the Goatse t-shirt in the New York Times interview](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/06/02/anil_goatses_the_nyt.html) as an example. I was looking at the list and one that I had somehow missed was "More Cowbell". (It's sort of the opposite of [stealth disco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_Disco).) Thanks to Google, I was able to find [a video of the original skit](http://gorillamask.net/morecowbell.shtml). (The link to the mp3 on [The Cowbell Project](http://www.geekspeakweekly.com/cowbell/) page was broken.)

[The Contagious Media Showdown](http://showdown.contagiousmedia.org/) targets this genre, but I wonder what it is that ends up becoming a pandemic in its virality. I guess it's something that is sort of stupid, but gets [funnier and funnier the more you repeat it](http://www.badgerbadgerbadger.com/).

I think that the "shared culture" aspect of it is important. It has to be simple (stupid) enough so that almost anyone will think it's funny or at least silly. I notice this with topics on blogs as well. Deep and well researched posts will often receive thoughtful comments, but it's the short [3-paragraph form](http://www.tnl.net/blog/entry/Secrets_of_the_A-List_Bloggers:_Lots_of_short_entries) that seems to consistently be the most read and linked. I don't think it's necessarily a good trend, but it's sort of the blog version of the TV sound-bite - the attention-span of the average blog reader.

I know that a lot of people sit around and think about memes a lot so I may be treading old ground, but I think it's interesting that non-geeks are getting sucked in and these shared ideas create some sort of community bonding that moves faster and at a larger scale than in the past, but still remains nichey and obscure...

UPDATE: Noticed the [Wikipedia Cowbell entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowbell) has a reference to this skit.
