There was [an article in the Wall Street Journal](http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05179/529696.stm) about the rise of more aggressive nationalist Japanese politicians. The article gives the example of the recent decision to willingness to challenge China, for instance, in the dispute over natural gas drilling in the East China Sea. These politicians, according to the article, are taking leadership away from the bureaucrats who traditionally ran most of the foreign policy. I haven't read much about this and have been away from Japanese politics for awhile, but if this article is accurate, it's a disturbing trend. I think the move for Japan to become more "normal" is a good thing, but I don't think that a nationalist position is a good one.

However, [the Asahi reports that 52% of Japanese polled say Koizumi should halt shrine visits](http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200506270298.html) and the [Japanese Emperor Akihito made a surprise visit to a Korean war dead memorial in Saipan on Tuesday](http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/international/international-japan-emperor-saipan.html).

So it appears to me that once again, the central government and the LDP are out of touch with the people and even the Emperor and it's the politicians who are fueling this nationalist mood. I wonder what we can do about it... It's clearly a bad idea.
