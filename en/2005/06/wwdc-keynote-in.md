[Kevin Marks](http://epeus.blogspot.com/2005_06_01_epeus_archive.html#111813021560407291) has created [a Quicktime movie of the Steve Jobs keynote at WWDC 2005 with chapters](http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/wwdc2005.mov) which makes it easier to view. This is the first time I've seen chapters. Pretty neat.
