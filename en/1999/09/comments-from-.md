Some comments on your essay:

"... She talked about the educational software market where there is no good
model for the evaluation of software and mothers end up buying what is on the
shelf. What is on the shelf, being driving more by advertising and marketing
than real evaluation. A community might be able to evaluate and develop this
market. There are many communities which straight advertising is not serving
well. ..."

it is not only that the consumers are not being served well. The developers
aren't either. There is basically this dense layer of distribution and marketing
which is taking a huge cut of the resources in the industry and also filtering
the content in particular ways. For example, it is the consensus in the industry
now that you can't have a successful kids title now without a strong license
at the level of Disney, Lucas, Barbie, or the "Sim" brand. This means that it
is impossible for independent developers to survive and for originally characters
to be developed. The fact that the industry has "matured" means that the stakes
are higher but also that you need major backing to be a player now. It also
means that the majority of the budgets these days are being spent on marketing
and distribution, which means less dollars proportionally for development and
creating quality products.

"The idea that a single market should determine everything is actually a product
of our very neo-classical economic view on society. In small communities, it
is possible that new forms of value and exchange are more relevant and dynamic
than large markets. "

Right. And if you look more wholistically at exchange systems rather than just
market economies, you would see that people actually have all kinds of "economies"
that are not supply and demand based or even "utilitarian" in the narrow economic
sense. The gift economy is one, but there are all sorts of other "regimes of
value" that are moblized ever day, like sexual exchange, the "home" economy
of families, status economies in professional communities, citational economies
in publications, and all sorts of different kinds of cultural capital that are
only recently being colonized by monetary systems are valulation. In my kids
software case, yes, parents and kids care about getting a good "value" but they
care more about what other kids are playing with, what is relevant to the school
curriculum, and what happens to be available at WalMart during their fifteen
minutes of discretionary shopping time. Decisions are very local. And on the
other side of the equation, it is not as if the labor of development is translated
transparently into the value or price of the product anymore. Value and price
tend to be an effects of a kind of collective social system of exchange rather
than something that can be attached to labor input or use value. Things are
much more complex and it is much harder to be reductive about valuation when
you are looking at cultural commodities.

"Takao Nakamura said that he thought it might be boring to work in an NPO with
a bureaucratic governance model. Similarly, Austin Hill described similar schemes
where ISP's have been run bo Co-ops where the committee becomes polulated by
boring people or the decision making becomes slow. It is necessary to invent
a robust and exciting governance model which includes a leadership that allows
the organization to make deals, be quick and be visionary.

" Are there any examples of this? I think it will all depend not only on a
governance model, but on the actual personalities involved. Maybe MUDs are an
example in microcosm... "Politically speaking, this NPO would have to be similar
to a nation-state. It would have to have strong beliefs, policies, likes and
dislikes, intelligent people, vision. It should exclude people who are not interested
in dropping out of the current advertising and market driven consumer market.
"

Probably you would see different layers of participation. Again, looking at
MUDs there are the gods, wizards, generic players etc. I think most people would
participate in the broader community through a specific niche community that
meets their local needs, such as wanting support for parenting, bicultural community
etc. The larger structure or governance model may be largely invisible, trasnparent
to the generic user, but through their participation, they would be supporting
the organization. Yes, the wizards need to hold the torch and carry the vision
to make it work, but for the end user it just needs to work. It's got to be
foremost just the best place to meet certain needs. Kind of like the Internet
at large works because there are a lot of activists holding the torch on a variety
of issues, but most users don't know or care why. So I'm not sure if it would
be a literal co-op model, but some hybrid maybe.

"It could be financed by donations and by savings on purchasing of infrastructure
and products directly. The users would own the platform. Isozaki-san of Netyear
mentioned that most Internet companies are already owned by the user. I think
the main difference will be that there will no exit for the shareholders, only
voting power. This would cut out speculators and shift the managment from growth
of revenue to happiness of the users... "

Yeah, kind of more a popularity contest in a social sense than market competition.
Like you say below, hybrid political economic.

"I have been listening to young and intelligent bureacrats and academics talk
about the lack of accountability. Many feel that solid policies necessary to
change society are disregarded on not implemented. These people are used to
working with option value. If organized properly, I feel that calling on the
resources of the academic and government worker community might yield a great
deal of people who would help develop the governance model. If a global network
of policy designers used the community and the Net to study and propose technically,
economically and globally solid proposals to governments, it may be possible
to make such proposals so indisputabily "right" that access to such policy would
become political power for compliant politicans. Such a group could gain a great
deal of reputation value on "vision" and global acceptability. This coupled
with the economic power of group buying and acquisition of vital assets, may
allow the community to grow to nation-like size. "

A lot of current marketing and distribution was born in an era that was still
constrained by a lot of physical geography issues which the net circumvents.
You needed to worry about inventory, print distribution, buying shelf space
etc. etc. I think we are at a good moment because the net is only just being
commercialized, and you still don't have serious net distribution yet. i.e.
the old systems haven't reproduced successfully on the net yet. I think it's
time for a new model. Like you say, there are a lot of people in the academic
community that have been thinking about this stuff, like CPSR, say.
