NPO Buyouts and Sustainable Communities DRAFT 0.2 9/22/99

I recently had a discussion with [my sister](http://www.itofisher.com/PEOPLE/mito/) about what we should do about the
"Momoko Ito Foundation" and the bicultural community project that we have. I have
been thinking a lot recently about community recently. Amano and I had talked
a bit about how Japanese seem to be taking a different angle, but that personal
communication seems to be quite important. Hector and I talked a bit about
multi-cultural and multi-lingual community sites. I also recently exchanged
some messages with [Howard Rheingold](http://www.rheingold.com/), Jeff Shapard and Lisa Kimball about the
state of community sites these days.

Anyway, [my sister](http://www.itofisher.com/PEOPLE/mito/) mentioned that she thought that many of the community sites
were too commercial looking these days. We all agree that the business model
for community sites has not yet been discovered. [my sister](http://www.itofisher.com/PEOPLE/mito/) (Mimi) is studying
from an anthropological point of view, small communities and how people in small
communities are tied together. She is focusing on Net communities. She talked
about the educational software market where there is no good model for the evaluation
of software and mothers end up buying what is on the shelf. What is on the shelf,
being driving more by advertising and marketing than real evaluation. A community
might be able to evaluate and develop this market. There are many communities
which straight advertising is not serving well.

Shibuya-san of Keio recommended that I read "An Introduction to Post-Keynesian
and Marxian Theories of Value and Price" by Peter M. Lichtenstein. In this
book Lichtenstein explains that neo-classical economics says that the market
and "demand" determine the price and value of something. Marx stated
that the labor that goes into production should determine the value. One can
also discuss the actual utility of an object to determine value. The idea that
a single market should determine everything is actually a product of our very
neo-classical economic view on society. In small communities, it is possible
that new forms of value and exchange are more relevant and dynamic than large
markets.

I have recently begun reading "Towards a New Economics" by Kenneth
E. Boulding which Jiro Kokuryo of Keio recommended to me and it also seems quite
relevant, discussing the area where economics ends and sociology takes over.

These recent exchanges and readings sparked an idea that maybe the users of
community should form an NPO and buyout the community platform. The NPO could
be governed in a way that suits the community the best.

One case would be if the users of a large community such as AOL offered to
buy AOL and take it private. Another would be if we collected various community
tools, managed them as an NPO, and as users increased and donations/tax increased,
the NPO could acquire more and more technology and resources.

Several thoughts on this.

Takao Nakamura said that he thought it might be boring to work in an NPO with
a bureaucratic governance model. Similarly, Austin Hill described similar schemes
where ISP's have been run by Co-ops where the committee becomes populated by
boring people or the decision making becomes slow. It is necessary to invent
a robust and exciting governance model which includes a leadership that allows
the organization to make deals, be quick and be visionary.

Politically speaking, this NPO would have to be similar to a nation-state.
It would have to have strong beliefs, policies, likes and dislikes, intelligent
people, vision. It should exclude people who are not interested in dropping
out of the current advertising and market driven consumer market.

It could be financed by donations and by savings on purchasing of infrastructure
and products directly. The users would own the platform. Isozaki-san of Netyear
mentioned that most Internet companies are already owned by the user. I think
the main difference will be that there will no exit for the shareholders, only
voting power. This would cut out speculators and shift the management from growth
of revenue to happiness of the users...

Finally, I think that Japan is an interesting place to start such a venture.
The US high-tech ventures require 150% growth to be classified as a "growth"
company. Without such a classification, there is no option value. Without option
value, there is no incentive for the jaded high tech employee. It is currently
too easy to make money in Silicon Valley and too difficult to incent people
without it. Japan is currently still in a depression and there are quite a few
people who are willing to make enough to survive if the work is interesting.

I also believe that eventually the US growth will slow down and option value
will decrease. Management structures and ethics developed around the growth
model may not be able to manage talent in such a state. If the NPO structure
I propose can manage to set a vision and incent intelligent individuals without
option value, such a structure may be able to accumulate disillusioned talent
from the Silicon Valley market after a market depression.

I have been listening to young and intelligent bureaucrats and academics talk
about the lack of accountability. Many feel that solid policies necessary to
change society are disregarded on not implemented. These people are used to
working with option value. If organized properly, I feel that calling on the
resources of the academic and government worker community might yield a great
deal of people who would help develop the governance model. If a global network
of policy designers used the community and the Net to study and propose technically,
economically and globally solid proposals to governments, it may be possible
to make such proposals so indisputably "right" that access to such
policy would become political power for compliant politicians. Such a group could
gain a great deal of reputation value on "vision" and global acceptability.
This coupled with the economic power of group buying and acquisition of vital
assets, may allow the community to grow to nation-like size.

On the other hand, the point of the community would not be to be dominant or
overbearing, but to serve the interests of pro-active and visionarily aligned
users. Companies, governments and other outside organizations could serve both
the needs of this community and others including the traditional markets. This
community would just be a sustainable community, or an island in the market.

Met with Takano-san of One Galaxy and he agrees with many of my points. We
discussed the "no-exit" business model and he had similar thoughts.
It is possible that a platform provider to the community could be a good business.
It could be an "exit" style business, or a sustainable business servicing
the community. The point would be to gain the economy of scale and have it fairly
priced so that the community would not want to switch. High switching cost could
be built in to the platform, but it would not be necessary.

On Trust... Using e-bay and after talking to Kokuryo-sensei about trust and
pricing on e-bay. It appears that trust in a community context may be more important
than trust in technology or brand. I recently bought a fountain pen on e-bay
and they offered to send me the pen before they received the check because "pen
collectors are trustworthy people." Ebay manages reputations.

A platform provider could be trustworthy in a political, person, or other way,
relying not necessarily on price, technology or brand to keep customers. This
reminds me of "old style" business. Like traditional trading companies.
Are we going backwards?

The observation that Kokuryo-sensei had on ebay was that prices for equivalent
products fluctuated greatly depending on the timing and the person selling the
product. The net is not creating a perfect economy where all prices are equalized
by the great market, but a more non-linear community oriented pricing mechanism
heavily influenced by consumer to consumer interaction. Fun fun! ;-)
