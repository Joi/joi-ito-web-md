| **Doubt and Certainty in Science** | **by J. Z. Young** |

Excellent book. The book was published in 1951 and the references
to computers are extremely dated, but his analysis of the brain, thinking, scientific
discovery, learning, evolution, etc. are very enlightening.

Young tries to look at human beings from the perspective of a
biologist. He tries to describe all aspects of humans including religion from
a biologists perspective. He looks at the brain as an organ and begins by describing
the brain and the neurons that make up the brain. He explains how these neurons
and their behavior can explain most of the behavior of humans. Remeniscient
of "Lost Worlds", he talks about the evolution of humans and how we
are more a product of our social environment than our DNA. (This is a very old
thread for me and something I would like to develop more in the future.) He
explains how atoms flow through the human body and explains that we are a "pattern"
and have nothing solid that persists over time. We are like a whirlpool. "Piology
like physics, has ceased to be material," he says. In this sense, evolution
of humans is about learning. Learning is about the brain. The neurons in our
brain throb happily until they are disturbed by some outside stimulus. They
try to come up with some solution that stops the noise and brings the brain
back into sync again. This process of disturbance and harmony is the "doubt
and certainty" in science he talks about. Learning, he says, is not all
as Pavlov and his conditioning shows. Humans look at things and think in order
to disturb or break up the harmony in order to discover better ways. He trys
to explain that studying the anatomy of the brain my give us insight into the
process of learning and help us evolve.

His vision seems to tie in well with the De Bono book about thinking
that I have just begun reading after being recommended to do so by Sen Nagata.
More on these thoughts later...
