# Self Esteem and the Information Age

In "Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity", Francis
Fukuyama explains that Japan, Germany and the US each had method of forming
large organizations based on trust. Germany had its guilds, the US had secular,
non-state controlled religion and Japan had non-blood based family structure
or "iemoto". Each of these systems allowed people to group into communities
and organizations basing their trust beyond the family, but not relying on the
state.

These systems of trust allowed large firms to develop and become the core of
capitalism, market economics and the manufacturing and distribution based global
economy. Today, the economy is shifting quickly from a manufacturing economy
to an information economy. In this change, the US is taking global leadership.
It appears that organizations must be resilient to change and very fast. An
important element in causing change and being fast is for people to question
authority, think for themselves and act. In the information age, only new or
different information adds value and what is required is creativity, not obedience.

For people to behave this way, they need to trust not the organizations, but
themselves. This trust comes from self esteem. California State Senator, John
Vaconscellos, calls for a government that governs through educating and causing
people to act responsibly because of self esteem rather than a government that
governs by causing obedience through shame and guilt. The self esteem idea is
has developed as a movement and is spreading. Unfortunately, such a movement
has not begun in Japan. Obviously education is an important part of self esteem,
but social capital and culture are also important in supporting self esteem.

In order for Japan to enter the Information Age new structures and a new way
of thinking is necessary. Japanese must change their mind set and the cultural
capital must be manage and developed. Simply mimicking the superficial aspects
of the US systems in not enough. After the war, the Keizai Doyukai helped build
a powerful country by supporting the development of communities and organizations
in business, politics and bureaucracy. For the Information Age, what is required
is not market oriented organizations, but communities based on people with self
esteem supported by culture, art and nonprofit organizations.
