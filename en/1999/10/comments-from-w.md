Subject: Re: NPO Buyouts and Sustainable Communities

Joichi- I liked the article on NPO buyouts and Sustainable Communities. It
echoes some of the concerns that I have about the Net. Basically, almost every
major player is there to get your credit card in some manner or fashion. And
you make a good point about not being able to attract the talent that is now
so concerned with stock options during this gold rush.

Of course we are in the same boat and we have investors who want the big returns
for the high risk. Given some of my social change background, we have some desire
to focus on the non-profit market. I am thinking of going to some of the foundations
in the US that might be able to bridge this issue by financing and manifesting
some of our work in the collaborative tools space.

The added value of working in this space might be that nonprofit share a common
do good mission as opposed to focusing on profits. Accordingly, though some
may argue with this, they may be ripe for the knowledge management tools that
could be applied ACROSS their different organizations without fearing the consequences
of sharing knowledge. We have one such application in development that is about
people sharing their contacts, using our GroupDOT platform.

But I don't know where the "governance" controls are. In the mutual fund industry
the users own the fund but make a contract with the manager. This contract must
be approved annually. Perhaps some kind of user group committee is created,
which might include a few representatives from management, that approves the
contract with the "managers." They take into account profit margins, etc. Of
course there are standard models in the mutual fund industry and our Internet
industry now has no such standards for proper community management. This user
group might approve of the kinds of ads that are placed, how often, fees and
charges for special services, and full disclosure and review of sensitive content
issues. Occasionally the user group may even authorize extra charges for a new
service that they want for their groups.

What is accomplished by the above is that you don't get a non-profit mentality
going among the managers. They need ways to win and create value and take responsibility.
And the big "win" for the managers is that the community becomes more trustworthy
with these controls, which will eventually keep and attract the choice users.
I am both chairman of Calvert Funds but also sit on the holding company board
of the Management company. It's an interesting dynamic and balancing act. But
$3 trillion dollars has been entrusted to mutual funds, partly as a result of
this way that trust it built. Of course this is also monitored by the SEC, but
generally it is a self regulating industry.

Thanks for allowing me to share this and you may pass on these remarks as you
see fit. Again, the key for me is to focus on the "standards" that the user
group oversight board might develop in determining what's appropriate for revenue
generation from the community but maintains the proper level of integrity.
