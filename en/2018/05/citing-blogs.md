On May 13, 2018, I innocently asked:  
> I may sound a bit naive, but as I read more academic papers in fields that I work in, I realize that they tend to cite academic papers more than blog posts even if there are better blog posts than the cited papers. It makes sense, but just noticing more specifically first hand.

240 replies later, it is clear that blogs don't make it into the academic journalsphere and people cited two main reasons, the lack of longevity of links and the lack of peer review. I would like to point out that my blog URLs have been solid and permanent since I [launched this version of my website in 2002](https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2002/06/27/site-soft-launc.html) but it's a fairly valid point. There are a number of ideas about how to solve this, and several people pointed out that [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) does a pretty good job of keeping an archive of many sites.

There was quite a bit of discussion about peer review. Karim Lakhani posted a link about a study he did on peer review:

In the study, he says that, "we find that evaluators systematically give lower scores to research proposals that are closer to their own areas of expertise and to those that are highly novel."

Many people on Twitter mentioned pre-prints which is an emerging trend of publishing drafts before peer review since it can take so long. Many fields are skipping formal peer review and just focusing on pre-prints. In some fields ad hoc and informal peer groups are reviewing pre-prints and some journals are even referring to these informal review groups.

This sounds an awful lot like how we review each other's work on blogs. We cite, discuss and share links -- the best blog posts getting the most links. In the early days of Google, this would guarantee being on the first page of search results. Some great blog posts like Tim O'Reilly's "[What Is Web 2.0](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html?)" have ended up becoming canonical. So when people tell me that their professors don't want them to cite blogs in their academic papers, I'm not feelin' it.

It may be true that peer review is better than the alternatives, but it definitely could be improved. [SCIgen](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/scigen/), invented in 2005 by MIT researchers creates meaningless papers that have been [successfully submitted to conferences](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03653). In 2014 Springer and IEEE removed more than 120 papers when [a French researcher discovered that they were computer-generated fakes](https://www.nature.com/news/publishers-withdraw-more-than-120-gibberish-papers-1.14763). Even peer review itself has been [successfully imitated by machines](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/09/22/many-academics-are-fooled-robot-written-peer-reviews).

At the Media Lab and MIT Press, we are working on trying to think about new ways to publish with experiments like [PubPub](https://www.pubpub.org/). There are [discussions about the future of peer review](https://prt.pubpub.org/). People like Jess Polka at [ASAPbio](http://asapbio.org/) are working on these issues as well. Very excited about the progress, but a long way to go.

One thing we can do is make blogs more citation friendly. Some people on Twitter mentioned that it's more clear who did what in an academic paper than on a blog post. I started, at the urging of Jeremy Rubin, to put credits at the bottom of blog posts when I received a lot of help -- [for example my post on the FinTech Bubble](https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2016/06/14/-the-fintech-bu.html). Also, Boris just added a "cite" button at the bottom of each of my blog posts. Try it! I suppose the next thing is to consider [DOI numbers](http://www.doi.org/) for each post although it seems non-obvious how independent bloggers would get them without paying a bunch of money.

One annoying thing is that the citation format for blogs suck. When you Goggle, "cite blog post," you end up at... a blog post about "[How to Cite a Blog Post in MLA, APA, or Chicago](http://www.easybib.com/guides/how-to-cite-a-blog-mla-apa-chicago/)." According to that blog post, the APA citation for this post would be, "Ito, J. (2018, May). Citing Blogs. [Blog post]. https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2018/05/28/citing-blogs.html" That's annoying. Isn't the name of my blog relevant? If you look at the [Citing Electronic Sources](https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/citing-your-sources/citing-electronic-sources) section of the MIT Academic Integrity website, they link to [the Purdue OWL page](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/10/). Purdue gives a slightly more cryptic example using a blog comment in the square brackets, but roughly similar. I don't see why the name of my blog is less important than some random journal so I'm going to put it in italics - APA guidelines be damned. Who do we lobby to change the APA guidelines to lift blog names out of the URL and into the body of the citation?
