In November 2017, I wrote with the help of some colleagues, "[Reducing Reduction: A Manifesto](https://pubpub.ito.com/pub/resisting-reduction/)". We received a number of interesting responses so the [Journal of Design and Science](https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/) decided to use it to create an [issue on the theme of Reducing Reduction](https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/issue-3). MIT Press [announced an essay competition](https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/essay-competition) for a publication from MIT Press.

Here are the details of the competition:

> **The MIT Press and the MIT Media Lab announce a call for essays on the topic of resisting reduction,** broadly defined, for the [Journal of Design and Science](https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/). Essays should be in conversation with Joi Ito's manifesto, "[Resisting Reduction](https://pubpub.ito.com/pub/resisting-reduction)," and the articles, also on this theme, published in the [third issue of JoDS](https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/issue-3).
>
> In support of open access scholarship and the free exchange of ideas, JoDS will award up to ten authors $10,000 each for chosen essays. Selections will run in JoDS under a Creative Commons license and will be published in an MIT Press volume. Proceeds from the publication of this volume will support open access publishing at MIT.
>
> This is an open competition and everyone is encouraged to submit a proposal.
>
> The submission deadline for essay proposals of no longer than 300 words is 2 March 2018. Semi-finalists will be notified on 2 April 2018 and invited to submit essays of 3,000 to 5,000 words. All selections will be made by the [JoDS editorial board](https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/about) and winners will be announced on 16 July 2018.
