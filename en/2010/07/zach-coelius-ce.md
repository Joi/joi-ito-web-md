Video of, Zach Coelius, CEO of [Triggit](http://triggit.com/) talking about Demand-Side Platforms and Real-Time Bidding. An increasing number of ad networks and exchanges have begun making their inventory available for real-time bidding, most notably Google. This allows companies like Triggit to look at lots of inventory across a number of networks and do real-time bidding based on sophisticated analytics.

This is an interesting trend that I think will change the ad landscape pretty dramatically and could help content providers by dramatically increasing the value of their ads. It also allows a level of control that might give ad agencies a new role to make more creative campaigns than just bulk targeting.
