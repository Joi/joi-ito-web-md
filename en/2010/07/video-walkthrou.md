Here's a video walkthrough of our Chiba home taken on the last day of my recent short trip there. I'm still getting used to the Flip Video and it tends to be a bit shakey and I'm pointing it a bit too downward. Also, Mizuka is trying to silently guide me through this shoot and sometimes grabs my shoulder which made it even shakier.

Anyway, hopefully my videos will improve through iteration. In the mean time, you can see what my Chiba home looks like during the beginning of summer in Japan.
