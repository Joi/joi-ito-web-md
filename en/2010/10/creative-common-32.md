Today Creative Commons launched its [Superhero Campaign](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/23583)! Please join me and CC in the fight for openness and innovation. Become a superhero by **[donating](https://creativecommons.net/donate)**, **[spreading the word](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCSuperhero_Toolkit)**, or **[fundraising on our behalf](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCSuperhero_Toolkit#Superhero_Fundraising_Page)**.

This week's featured superhero is [Neeru Khosla](https://creativecommons.net/superheroes/neeru-khosla/), co-founder of the CK-12 Foundation, a nonprofit organization that provides CC licensed textbooks for K-12 education.
