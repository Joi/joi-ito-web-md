We [launched our Catalyst Campaign](http://creativecommons.org/catalyst) to raise $100,000 by June 30th for our new [Catalyst Grants program](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Grants).

If you care about CC, and keeping the web open and accessible, please [donate today](https://support.creativecommons.org/donate). We need everyone's help!

> We're thrilled today to announce the launch of the Catalyst Campaign - from now through June 30, Creative Commons is raising money to fund our recently-launched [Catalyst Grants](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Grants) program.
>
> Catalyst Grants will make it possible for individuals and organizations to harness the power of Creative Commons. A grant might enable a group in a developing country to research how Open Educational Resources can positively impact its community. Another could support a study of entrepreneurs using Creative Commons licenses to create a new class of socially responsible businesses.
>
> [But we can't do it without your help](https://support.creativecommons.org/donate). Our goal is to raise $100,000 from CC supporters like you to fund the grants that will make all this possible. [Donate today](https://support.creativecommons.org/donate) to help spread our mission of openness and innovation across all cultural and national boundaries.
>
> Special thanks to the [Milan Chamber of Commerce](http://www.milanomediterraneo.org/) for recognizing the importance of funding this initiative by generously donating EUR 10,000! The Milan Chamber of Commerce and its [Promos Network](http://www.promos-milano.it/) already work to promote international collaboration and innovation and we're honored they've stepped up to jumpstart the campaign.
