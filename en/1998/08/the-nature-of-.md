Coase comes up with a definition of the "firm" as an organization that defines
employer and employee, master and servant which satisfies the "plain man's"
definition of the firm. Coase explains that transaction cost optimization can
account for the need of the firm.

The thesis is interesting and his discussion of other theories is rigorous
and useful, but Coase's conclusion and logic is limited in many of the same
ways as the theories he tries to tear down.

First of all, the idea that there is some kind of curve that can show when
a firm is the right size, albeit the firm may be in several product areas is
a bit linear. Also, he doesn't really discuss in depth some of the knowledge
and competence that can be held in a firm and account for its fitness or value.
Obviously silicon valley and virtual companies didn't exist in 1937 when he
published the paper, but I think that the technological advances that caused
the scalability and transaction cost performance that gave birth to the firm
are now giving birth to virtual firms and communities that transcend the firm.

As a paper to set the definition of the firm and set a milestone, it was very
interesting.

In afterthought and particularly after talking to Iwamura-san, it appears that
Coase does describe the firm as something beyond the market. Iwamura-san noted
after my reference to Coase that Coase was not the first person to think of
this. In any case, some people, like Iwamura-san will argue that everything
is just an extension of the market.
