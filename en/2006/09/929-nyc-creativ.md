If you'll be around New York City on September 29, please join us at [Irving Plaza](http://www.irvingplaza.com/) for a Creative Commons concert presented by [WIRED](http://www.wired.com/) and [Flavorpill](http://beta.flavorpill.net/). The show will feature [Mike Patton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Patton)'s experimental pop supergroup [Peeping Tom](http://www.myspace.com/peepingtomispatton), DJ/producer [Diplo](http://www.myspace.com/diplo), and mash-up/remix artist [Girl Talk](http://www.myspace.com/girltalkmusic). Creative Commons' CEO Lawrence Lessig will be on hand to introduce the artists.

This concert is a great way to show your support for our work, as proceeds from all ticket sales will go directly to Creative Commons (please note that ticket price is \*not\* tax-deductible). Tickets are $25 each (plus service charge) and are available online at [Ticketmaster](http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/00003D270ACE4DB9?artistid=1041799&majorcat).

The event is a part of Next Music, which kicks off [WIRED NextFest](http://www.nextfest.net/), a four-day festival featuring more than 130 interactive exhibits from scientists and researchers from around the world.

Please join us if you can. Again, 100% of the proceeds from every ticket sold go directly to Creative Commons.
