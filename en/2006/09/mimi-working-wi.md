My sister (who is often referred to as the quiet but smarter one in the family) is working with one of my favorite people, Howard Rheingold. She gave a talk on "Amateur Cultural Production in the New Networked Age." [Howard has blogged it on the DIY Media Weblog](http://weblogs.annenberg.edu/diy/2006/09/mizuko_ito_on_amateur_cultural.html) where the conversation is continuing. I've been stealing my best talk content from these two for a long time. So here is the "attribution." ;-)
