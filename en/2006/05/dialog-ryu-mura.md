Ryu Murakami ([WP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryu_Murakami)) and I spent the last nine months or so meeting occasionally to chat about Japanese culture, politics, media and the economy. Creative Garage and Diamond Shuppan transcribed our conversation and published it as [a book](http://joi.ito.com/moblog/entries/2006/05/26/004252.html). ([You can buy it on Amazon.co.jp](http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/books/4478942269/).) The book came out last week and climbed to #6 on the [Amazon.co.jp book rankings](http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/tg/new-for-you/top-sellers/-/books/all/ref=pd_dp_ts_b_1/249-9554867-2061137) and is slowly settling back down. (It's #14 at the time of this posting.) That was pretty exhilarating. Having said that, Ryu Murakami is "the name" on the book. Anyway, thanks to everyone who helped on the book and especially to Ryu.

The book is in Japanese and currently we have no plans to translate it.
