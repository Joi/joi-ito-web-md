I'll be giving a talk today at the SDForum in Mountain View. This section is called: Virtual Worlds---The Rules of Engagement.

My talk is [4:00pm - 4:45pm Keynote - The Future of the Metaverse](http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1910&mo=5&yr=2006)

Not sure exactly what I'm going to talk about, but I'll probably be bopping around [IRC](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?ircchannel), Second Life and World of Warcraft so maybe see you in one of the places or at the conference.
