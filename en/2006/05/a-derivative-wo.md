I KNEW people would make creative use of the CC licensed video I uploaded.

[The WoW section subtitled](http://insanecats.com/media/wow/joi.html). By [Kazpah](http://wowblogs.net/eitrigg/kazpah/) our friendly neighborhood Warlock.

And NO. That's NOT what I said. ;-P

The video requires some quicktime stuff and won't run in many players. If anyone knows how to convert it to other formats, let us know. FWIW, it seems to work in Safari on my Mac, but not in Firefox... and it will take awhile to download.
