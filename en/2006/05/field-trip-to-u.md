Undercity is a Horde city in the World of Warcraft. A few weeks ago some of our guild members and friends decided to take a field trip to Undercity. We snuck in through the sewers and pwned some guards and a battlemaster. I found the video on my hard disk this morning during the conference so I decided to edit it and put some music to it.

The music is [Nebula Dub by \_ghost](http://ccmixter.org/media/files/_ghost/5678) that I found on ccMixter. The song is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.5 license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) so this video is as well. It's about 5 min. ([AVI](http://media.ito.com/video/undercity1.avi) / [MP4](http://media.ito.com/video/undercity1.mp4))

UPDATE: yeah yeah... I know the AVI version sucks.
