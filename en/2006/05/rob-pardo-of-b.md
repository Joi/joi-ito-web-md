Jason took this picture of Rob Pardo, the lead game developer of World of Warcraft and VP of Game Design of Blizzard and me at the Wired Rave Awards reception last night. Rob and his team won a Wired Rave Award this year and I wrote the article for the magazine. It was a big treat to get to hang out with Rob and get his view on MMOs and WoW. Thanks Rob and thanks Wired!
