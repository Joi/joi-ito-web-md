I've just uploaded the 50 min special produced by Digital Garage and directed by Hiroyuki Nakano for MX TV (and the Net.) All of the content is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/). It is a [308 MB MOV file](http://media.ito.com/mx/mx1c.mov) / [iPod Video file](http://media.ito.com/mx/mx1b.m4v). This 50 min show is a warmup for a weekly 30 min live show that I will be doing from July. The master is in HD format and I'll upload it at some point.

This show is about Creative Commons and has lots of scenes of me just talking about stuff. It includes a walk-through of my house and is Joi-centric. Sorry. ;-P It's also in Japanese. We're going to possibly make and English sub-titled version. If anyone wants to help, let me know. Since it is CC-BY, feel free to chop it up and do whatever.

[Hiroyuki Nakano](http://www.peacedelic.co.jp/nakano/profile/index.html) is a well know director famous for doing the DEEELITE music videos, Samurai Fiction and many other amazing video pieces and it was a huge pleasure to work with him and also watch him get switched on to CC. We tried to figure out the best way to do attribution in video. Thoughts on the icons and format would also be greatly appreciated.

It will air on MX TV 29.April 2006 2100~2155.

UPDATE: If anyone decides to edit it, can you replace the credits at the end with:

Produced by Digital Garage  
Peacedeliced by Hiroyuki Nakano  
Directed by Shuichi Fujiyasu

I'm going to fix it in the next version, but I'm leaving the current one up there until I do.
