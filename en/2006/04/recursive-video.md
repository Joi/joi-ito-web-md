Had our first meeting inside of Second Life today to talk about the island. Thanks to everyone who showed up. Special thanks to Aimee Weber who donated an amphitheater! She showed me how to play videos inside of Second Life. So... I tried making a very recursive video of me watching a video of me watching a test video of myself. Watching a video together inside of Second Life actually works well. The audio and video quality is excellent and you can chat about the video and other things while you watch. It's really neat sharing a space like this together...

I uploaded a [video iPod format m4v](http://media.ito.com/video/recursivesl2.m4v) and a [AVI format](http://media.ito.com/video/recursivesl2.avi) of the movie. Too bad the audio does't work... or for your sake, maybe it's better that it didn't.
