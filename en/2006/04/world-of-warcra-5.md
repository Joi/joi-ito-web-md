Our [World of Warcraft guild](http://weknow.to/) has been running Molten Core (one of the end-games) on weekends. We now have a fairly reliable turnout of 40 people for the raids and have started making progress with the bosses. We cleared Lucifron, Magmadar, Gehennas and just [took down Garr](http://weknow.to/vanilla/comments.php?DiscussionID=522). ([smallish mov](http://media.ito.com/video/pwngarr.mov) / [bigger avi](http://media.ito.com/video/pwngarr.avi) / [270MB hi-quality mov](http://media.ito.com/video/pwngarrhd.mov)) It took us a few tries and isn't as easy (especially the setup) as it looks in the video, but it should be pretty easy from now on. We seem to have our communications and planning relatively organized now and with the help of some of the more experienced players should be able to keep moving until we hit a boss that requires us to get new gear. What is interesting to me about these raids is the combination of preparation, planning and real-time coordination necessary to execute properly and I imagine how these skills could be used for conducting other sorts of activities.
