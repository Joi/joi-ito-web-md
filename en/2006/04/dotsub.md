Laurie Racine showed me a very nifty site that allows people to subtitle videos in various languages. I SO want my TV show stuff set up like this. It make sense to make the content some sort of derivative works permissive CC license because translations are derivative works as far as I know. The site is called [dotSUB](http://dotsub.com/).
