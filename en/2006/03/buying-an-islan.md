I am considering buying an island on [Second Life](http://secondlife.com/) so I can donate land to various non-profit projects that I'm involved in. I've set up [a wiki page for this](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?second_life_island). I will also probably set up a set for shooting video for video blogging and my TV show. If you're interested in participating in this project or have thoughts, please contribute to the wiki.
