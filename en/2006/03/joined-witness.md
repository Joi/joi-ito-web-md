Ever since [I met Gillian Caldwell](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/09/20/witness_human_rights_advocacy_with_video_and_it.html) the executive director of WITNESS in 2003 I've been fascinated with their work. [WITNESS](http://www.witness.org/) is is an organization that "partners with human rights defenders, training them to use video to document abuse and create change".
> Witness Mission Statement

> WITNESS advances human rights advocacy through the use of video and communications technology. In partnership with more than 150 non-governmental organizations and human rights defenders in 50 countries, WITNESS strengthens grassroots movements for change by providing video technology and assisting its partners to use video as evidence before courts and the United Nations, as a tool for public education, and as a deterrent to further abuse. WITNESS also gives local groups a global voice by distributing their video to the media and on the Internet, and by helping to educate and activate an international audience around their causes.

I'd been talking to Gillian about using the Internet and blogs more for their work and last year [we set up a TypePad blog for her](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/05/10/gillian_caldwells_new_blog.html) when she went to Sierra Leone with Angelina Jolie to deliver recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's (TRC) to the government. [The blog](http://witness.typepad.com/gillian_in_salone/) was a big success. Since then, I had been trying to provide advice and support and recently they allowed me to join [their board](http://www.witness.org/blogcategory/Directors/). I'm very excited to be working with them and any thoughts on how we can make WITNESS better would be greatly appreciated!
