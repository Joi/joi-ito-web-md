[Justin](http://ww.links.net/) and [Merci](http://www.artserf.net/) shot some video for my upcoming TV show and did a on-the-road quick cut of the first night and [uploaded it to Archive.org](http://www.archive.org/details/JoiSXSW2006March12). [Note: Try the [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNMSJo_4r4) or [Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/clip=54591) link. The 200MB archive.org one will take ages, but if you want to mess with the video, feel free to download.] We'll put up a torrent soon, but you can see some of the people I met last night wandering around Austin.

Thanks for the help Justin and Merci!

UPDATE: Sorry it's a bit large. I thought Archive.org made smaller versions of it. We'll try to upload a smaller version tomorrow for people who don't feel like downloading 200MB. ;-P

UPDATE 2: I just uploaded an 8.5M version. Please do not deep link this since it is not a permanent location, but I just wanted to save people from having download 200MB+ just to hear us ramble. Also, the credits say "Creative Commons Share Alike", but the CC license used is [CC Attribution 2.5 license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/). (I just realized that I uploaded a slightly older version with crappier sound and the mistake at the end with the license. We'll update this once Justin wakes up. ;-) )

UPDATE 3: The Director's notes:
> One evening's interviews with people in Austin, Texas for South by Southwest: Interactive. Here Joichi Ito interviews Eric Steuer of Creative Commons; Wagner James Au, of Second Life; Mike Hudack of blip.tv; Trei Brundrett with Forward Together (Mark Warner); Doc Searls; Halley Suitt of toptensources.com. The camerawork and editing by Merci Hammon and Justin Hall. This is the first experiment taping Joichi Ito's travels and conversations in technology culture.

UPDATE 4: [On YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNMSJo_4r4) and [Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/clip=54591).

UPDATE 5: Thanks to Justin and Merci we have hours and hours of excellent footage. They're dumping onto disk now. All of the footage is originally shot in HD format. The uploaded video is a rough cut of just one of the eight tapes or so that they did overnight just to try the "field editing" thingie. Hopefully we'll have a steady flow of stuff as we get more of the footage edited. Stay tuned...
