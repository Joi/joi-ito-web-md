Sean Bonner has [just posted an almost "too weird to be true" story](http://suicidegirls.com/news/technology/14604/) about a guy who works at SmartFilter, a web filtering company that "protects children" from dirty content. They have been the target of a lot of blogging recently after [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/) ended up on their filter list and have been trying to be removed. It looks like the guy that they have been interacting with at the filter company is an Adult Baby or AB. (ABs like to dress up and act like babies.) Sean cites Violet Blue, a noted sex educator who thinks it is probably a bad idea for an AB to be in the business of "protecting children".

I personally don't like digging up trash on people and generally believe that people's sexual preferences shouldn't be "outed" in public. However, I think that bad filter companies really hurt the Internet and if someone's motivation to "protect children" is possibly driven by a fetish, it should probably be noted.

UPDATE: [A balanced post about this from Xeni on Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/03/10/smartfilter_boingboi.html).
