[Wikia](http://www.wikia.com/) is the for-profit wiki company founded by Jimmy Wales, the founder of [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/). They announced their raise today. I invested as an angel investor and will be serving on the board. Wikia will be using and contributing to the [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) wiki platform that Wikipedia uses, but will provide free hosting for people who want to use the Wikia for special interests and topics. The content will be [GFDL](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html) licensed. See [the press release](http://www.wikia.com/wiki/Press_releases/March_2006) for more information.
