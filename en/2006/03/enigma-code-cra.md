Very interesting [story on CNET](http://news.com.com/Distributed+computing+cracks+Enigma+code/2100-1029_3-6043572.html) about how distributed computing helped crack one of the last remaining dispatches using Germany's Enigma code from World War II.

Check out the original coded message and the translation [here](http://www.bytereef.org/m4-project-first-break.html).

The codebreakers, [the M4 Message Breaking Project](http://www.bytereef.org/m4_project.html), worked by enlisting volunteers to downloaded the codebreaking software into the background of their computers.

What other historic mysteries could distributed computing help solve?
