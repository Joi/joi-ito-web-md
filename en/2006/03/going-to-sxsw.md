I'm about to leave for San Francisco for a Mozilla board meeting before heading over to [South by Southwest](http://2006.sxsw.com/). I've set up [a wiki page](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?sxsw_2006_schedule) to coordinate stuff I'm going to do at SXSW. Let me know if you're going to be there or if there are any events I should know about. See ya!
