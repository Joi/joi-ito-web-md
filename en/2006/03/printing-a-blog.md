I was recently approached by a publisher who wants to translate my [Chinese Anti-Japan Protests](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/04/19/chinese_anti-japan_protests.html) post and some of the comments into Japanese and publish them as a book. This site is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license so legally they can do this without asking permission. However, I am worried that some people might be posting comments on this blog without being aware that their comments are also covered under this license. If you have contributed to the post and would not like to have your comments translated into Japanese and reprinted, please let me know. Any royalties or fees I might receive for this I will donate to [Global Voices](http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/), which is the most relevant project to this post.
