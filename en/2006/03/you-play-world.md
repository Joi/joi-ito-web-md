[Great Wired article by John Seely Brown about World of Warcraft](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.04/learn.html) and what you learn when you play it.
> And that's exactly what Gillett is doing. He accepted Yahoo!'s offer and now works there as senior director of engineering operations. "I used to worry about not having what I needed to get a job done," he says. "Now I think of it like a quest; by being willing to improvise, I can usually find the people and resources I need to accomplish the task." His story - translating experience in the virtual world into success in the real one - is bound to become more common as the gaming audience explodes and gameplay becomes more sophisticated.

The savviest employers will get the message.
