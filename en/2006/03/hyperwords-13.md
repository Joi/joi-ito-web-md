[Hyperwords](http://www.hyperwords.net/), which I wrote about in [June last year](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/06/29/hyperwords.html), released a new version. Hyperwords is a nifty extension to Firefox that creates contextual menus that sends words selected on a web page to various services. It's improved significantly since the initial release and has become a standard part of my Firefox setup.

Disclosure: I've agreed to be an advisor to Frode and the Hyperwords team.
