> Last month, Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) gave a rather stunning [speech](http://www.chezlark.com/?p=666) on the issue of net neutrality, in which he made such clueless statements as: "I just the other day got, an internet was sent by my staff at 10 o’clock in the morning on Friday and I just got it yesterday," and "[T]he internet is not something you just dump something on. It’s not a truck. It’s a series of tubes."

> Now, the good folks at [Boldheaded](http://www.boldheaded.com/2006/07/dj-ted-stevens-techno-remix-series-of.html) have turned his "skillful fusion of political doublespeak and perplexing ignorance on how the Internet works" into the DJ Ted Stevens Techno Remix: "A Series of Tubes."

I DID NOT KNOW that the Internet was a series of tubes.

Very funny. ;-)
