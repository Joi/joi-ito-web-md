I've blogged about [Continuous Partial Attention](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/03/29/continuous_partial_attention.html). There is a difference between having CPA and multi-tasking. [Linda Stone](http://lindastone.net) is the person who first turned me on to this concept and now she has a wiki about [Continuous Partial Attention](http://continuouspartialattention.com). Yay!
