Almost like clockwork, hitting 40 years old seems to have triggered a series of alarms that I need to watch my health more. Blood tests show various things that I need to watch out for and I continue to be fatter than I should. I used to do low-carb diets when I got overweight, but it seems like a fat/meat diet right now wouldn't be good for my heart and other things.

I was discussing exercise plans and being fat with a friend of mine who recommended that I check out [Eat to Live](http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Live-Revolutionary-Formula-Sustained/dp/0316829455/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_k2a_1_img/103-6955446-3697407) by [Dr. Fuhrman](http://drfuhrman.com/). I googled around looking for more information. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Fuhrman) provided rather bland neutral results. [Some people seemed critical of him](http://blogcritics.org/archives/2004/07/18/141813.php), but in the comments were blasted by others who disagreed. I couldn't find anything authoritatively negative about this book or Dr. Fuhrman. (I didn't look TOO hard though.)

[His website](http://drfuhrman.com/) and the book come off a bit salesy, but I tend to expect that from mass market books in the US. I've just started reading the book. I apologize for blogging before I read, but I wanted to post this while I read the book in case anyone had experience with Dr. Fuhrman, his recommendations in his book or thoughts on his assertions.

It is pretty straightforward. Eat lots of fiber. Cut down on meats, fish, oil and carbs. He has a notion of health = nutrition / calories and the importance of focusing on foods that have a high nutrition vs calorie ration. Fruits are OK.

Anyway, I think I'm going to give this a try. It starts with a 6 week aggressive "detox" and then goes into a more forgiving mode that allows you to eat most anything, but requires you to take in large amounts of vegetables and fruits.
