Does anyone know of any good nutrition tracking software on the Mac? I want to be able to enter what I'm eating and have it produce a report of nutrients including vitamins and minerals. There are references with the information as well as nifty packages that keep track of what you eat and chart calories. However, I have yet to find something on the Mac that lets you track nutrients other than calories (and breakdown of calorie type) and a few other basics like sodium. It looks like there is a package for Windows called [NutriBase](http://www.dietsoftware.com/highend.shtml).

Another requirement is that it is metric friendly.

The problem I'm having is that since supplements and diets are such a big business online, online search results are cluttered with spam... \*sigh\*

I suppose I could run some Windows emulator on the Mac. How good are they? I've sort of stay away from them assuming they would take up too much disk space and CPU, but maybe I should try it...

Anyway, I'll post any findings here and keep looking.

UPDATE: Decided to go ahead and get the NutriBase package and start running it on my windows laptop. Looks great. I wish I had it for the Mac. Maybe this means I need to run Windows on my Mac. Gah...
