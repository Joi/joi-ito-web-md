I'm at Narita Airport waiting for my flight to Berlin via Frankfurt to attend the [23rd Chaos Communications Congress](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Home) aka 23C3 as well as the [iCommons](http://icommons.org/) board meeting. This is the third year that I've attended. It's one of my favorite conference with thousands of hackers converging on the Congress Center in Berlin. This year Digital Garage will be a sponsor of the conference and I will have a small team of folks including the [MXTV BlogTV](http://www.trj.weblogs.jp/blogtv/) team covering the evening and doing some interviews. As always, the content will be released under a [Creative Commons Attribution License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/) and will be uploaded to You Tube and other places.

I'll be in Berlin until the 31st and travel back to Japan on New Years Eve just like last year. My big question is whether New Years Eve is including in the "end of the year" through which the in-flight Wifi is supposed to work.

This is the first flight I've taken since I started my ETL program and it's rather weird. Thinking about the logistics of getting tons of vegetables in Berlin feels almost upside down from the last time I went too. I'm sure I'll get used to it, but it's a bit disorienting.
