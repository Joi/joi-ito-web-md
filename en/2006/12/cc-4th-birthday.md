> Since most of CC's supporters are spread out around the world we thought that it would be awesome to see how many of our international affiliates would interested in hosting CC celebrations of their own!. So even though you may not be able to attend the SF party don't fret because there are now CC Celebration parties in [Warsaw, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Lisbon, Portuga](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Birthday_party#Parties "Warsaw, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Lisbon, Portugal")l (as part of their initial [launch](http://creativecommons.org/worldwide/pt/ "launch")), and [New York City](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Birthday_party#Parties "New York City"). If you don't see a party in you country, talk to your nearest [CC affiliated jurisdiction project lead](http://creativecommons.org/worldwide "CC affiliated jurisdiction project lead") about having a party or just meeting up in an informal place like your local coffee shop, friend's house or bar.

> If you are unable to make any of those locations but can make it virtually then we can accomodate that too!

> As a way for all the global commoners to be able to celebrate together we are asking that everyone document their celebrations with videos and photographs. Upload them with the tag "ccb-day", "city" (i.e. Berlin), and any other identifying tags, so we can pick them up and channel them through [Stage6](http://stage6.divx.com/index "Stage6"), the video and image content platform. If you would like to upload to Stage6 directly the format is DiVX. If you are unfamiliar it's easy to use and they have help for both [Macs](http://www.divx.com/divx/mac/guides/ "Macs") and PC. The open source application for PC's is [Dr. DiVX](http://labs.divx.com/DrDivX "Dr. DiVX") and they have [how-to videos](http://stage6.divx.com/Dr_DivX "how-to videos") for Dr. DiVX as well. also host informational videos. We are also encouraging commoners to support CC by uploading a short video or written testimonial about you support CC and use "cc" "testimonial" "city" and any other identifying tags. We want to know your stories and share them with the rest of the world.

See you there!

UPDATE: I will be there via Second Life
