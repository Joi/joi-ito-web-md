I'm at the SFO airport on my way to Sao Paulo for the ICANN meeting. After a cancelled flight, I think I'm back on course.

There is a [Sao Paulo ICANN meeting blog](http://sp.icann.org/) where I'll try to post stuff once I figure out the posting policy.

UPDATE: There is a [webcast](http://sp.icann.org/webcast) and a [chatroom](http://sp.icann.org/chatrooms).
