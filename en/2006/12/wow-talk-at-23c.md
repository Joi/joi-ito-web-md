[I posted some links of videos and notes from my talk about the World of Warcraft at 23C3 on my guild forums](http://weknow.to/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2518).

Update: [Emory posted it to Google Video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5160442894955175707). Thanks!

PS: I usually don't pimp my talks this much, but a few people asked for it so I'm following up. ;-P
