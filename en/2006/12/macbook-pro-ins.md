I apologize for being too lazy to search around the Internet for a discussion on this, but has anyone noticed that their MacBook Pro has gotten WORSE after the recent firmware patch to FIX issues with sleeping? I find my MacBook Pro getting into this annoying state of fan-whirring insomnia mode where it doesn't sleep, but won't wake up.
