I'm randomly losing email for some reason. If you've sent something and haven't heard back, please send it again. Sorry.

UPDATE

This is a request for help. I'm currently using a Gmail hosted account and using Mail on OS X to retrieve my mail via POP. The setting on the Gmail side is to archive mail that has been retrieved by POP. Sometimes I browse email via the browser.

The weird thing that is happening is that blocks of mail or single messages are not showing up in the client, but are being archived in the "All Mail" section of my Gmail account.

I tried rebuilding the Inbox on my Mac, moved the messages to another folder and rebuilt with 0 messages. (Confirmed a clean .plist file.) Then I tried deleting the Inbox folder completely and allowed Mail on the Mac to rebuild it from scratch. I think I'm still getting this error.

Any ideas on what this could be and how I can resolve this?
