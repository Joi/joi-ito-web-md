David Beckemeyer's PhoneGnome just did a pretty substantial upgrade. You can now use any SIP device to call PhoneGnome users for free. The new website lets you set up the call easily. You can also register all of your phone number (mobile phone, etc.) and not just the land line that your PhoneGnome is connected to.

[Here's an announcement on their blog.](http://www.phonegnome.com/blog/?p=76)
