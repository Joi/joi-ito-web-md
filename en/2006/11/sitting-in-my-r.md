I seem to be doing this more and more, but I'm sitting in my hotel room [watching the webcast](http://igf2006.intgovforum.org/node/288) and [chatting in the chatroom](http://igf2006.intgovforum.org/security-chatroom) for the IGF meeting. Until they make it easier for people to use their computers on site, I'm going to continue doing this.

I realize it is slightly rude to have your computer open during conferences, but the ability to look things up, take notes and chat are much more important than appearing slightly rude IMHO.
