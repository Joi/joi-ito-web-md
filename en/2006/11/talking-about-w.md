[I'll be giving a short (10 min) talk about the World of Warcraft at the Web 2.0 Conference in San Francisco later today.](http://www.web2con.com/cs/web2006/view/e_spkr/1703) One paper that inspired some of my thinking (and will inspiring a longer blog post soon) is an excellent working paper by John Seely Brown and Douglas Thomas that you can get from the [USC Annenberg Center Working Papers site.](http://weblogs.annenberg.edu/workingpapers/)
