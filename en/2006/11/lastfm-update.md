Last.fm just [pushed an update](http://www.last.fm/updates/) that just made my day.

There is a new event system including user event posting where you can see who is going to the event. There is a new flash radio player, a "taste-o-meter" and a new downloads area.

I love the "new site smell". Congratulations to the last.fm team for a great update.
