I did a funny interview with Jane Pinkard from [gamegirladvance](http://www.gamegirladvance.com/archives/2006/02/08/are_mmos_the_new_golf.html) for [1up](http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3147826). It also ran in [PC Magazine](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1922782,00.asp), [The Inquirer](http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=29588) and got picked up on [slashdot](http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/02/09/1941234). In it, we talk about WoW being "The New Golf". For the record, the first person I ever heard referring to WoW as "The New Golf" was Cory Ondrejka from Linden Lab when we were waiting for our flight in Berlin after 22C3.
