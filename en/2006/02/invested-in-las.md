I've generally stopped making new investments other than in particularly exceptional situations. However, [last.fm](http://last.fm) is one of those exceptions and I wanted to let you know that I invested together with Reid Hoffman, CEO of [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/) and Stefan Glänzer, CEO of [20six](http://www.20six.com) Weblog Services AG in the UK in October. It is the first time I've invested in this trilateral formation, but with the company in the UK, a lot of potential partners in the US and a big market in Japan, this team seems to make sense. Apologies for the late announcement, but we've been working on some deals that made it difficult for me to talk about our investment publicly. [I wrote about the first in 2004](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/09/26/lastfm.html) and later [in 2005 after they did the redesign.](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/08/13/lastfm.html) I'm really happy that after working with them for years now, our relationship is now more formal and aligned. Please see the links above or go to their site for more information about the service.
