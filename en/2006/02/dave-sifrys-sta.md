Dave has posted Part 1 of another round of his now regular State of the Blogosphere reports. Part 1 is about Blogosphere Growth.

Here is the Summary:
> \* Technorati now tracks over 27.2 Million blogs  
> \* The blogosphere is doubling in size every 5 and a half months  
> \* It is now over 60 times bigger than it was 3 years ago  
> \* On average, a new weblog is created every second of every day  
> \* 13.7 million bloggers are still posting 3 months after their blogs are created  
> \* Spings (Spam Pings) can sometimes account for as much as 60% of the total daily pings Technorati receives  
> \* Sophisticated spam management tools eliminate the spings and find that about 9% of new blogs are spam or machine generated  
> \* Technorati tracks about 1.2 Million new blog posts each day, about 50,000 per hour  
> \* Over 81 Million posts with tags since January 2005, increasing by 400,000 per day  
> \* Blog Finder has over 850,000 blogs, and over 2,500 popular categories have attracted a critical mass of topical bloggers
