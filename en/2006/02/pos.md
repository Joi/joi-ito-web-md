Yahoo has once again been [accused by Reporters Sans Frontieres](http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=16402%22), the Paris-based press freedom watchdog group, of turning over information about a computer user in China.

Reporters Sans Frontieres said the user, Li Zhi, was sentenced to eight years in prison for "inciting subversion" based on electronic records provided by Yahoo. Li, a 35-year-old ex-civil servant from Dazhou, used the e-mail address [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and user-name lizhi34100 to post comments in online discussion groups about corruption of local officials.

Yahoo declined to comment, [according to CNET's report](http://news.com.com/2061-10796_3-6037055.html?part=rss&tag=6037055&subj=news).

On a personal level this raises the privacy issue: How can I know the extent to which a company is protecting my private information?

One solution: Encourage companies to disclose each time they have received a subpoena. This would not be perfect, but it would at least give an idea of the threats to privacy. Any other ideas?
