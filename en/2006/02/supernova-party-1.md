I'll be in SF briefly for a Creative Commons board thingie this weekend. I'm arriving on the 16th and if I'm not too tired, I'll try to make it to the [Supernova Party](http://www.socialtext.net/snparty/). Maybe see here there.

Details:
> Thursday, February 16  
> 5:30-9:30pm (come whenever you can)  
> Cha-Am Thai, 701 Folsom St. (at 3rd), San Francisco

Cost is $20 per person, which includes a full Thai dinner and non-alcoholic drinks. RSVP and pre-payment details at the wiki URL above.UPDATE: A dinner meeting ran late and I'm too sleepy to go tonight... I'm sorry.
