Wired magazine writes about the so-called phenomenon of [podfading](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,70171-0.html?tw=rss.index): When someone stops doing a podcast.

Reasons cited for stopping podcasts:  
- Boredom  
- No success  
- Overwhelming success  
- No money

Meanwhile, the US-based National Public Radio this week reached the milestone of 13 million podcasts downloaded just six months after it started podcasting.

At the pace mainstream media is entering the new media space, will today's star bloggers and podcasters be tomorrow's roadkill?
