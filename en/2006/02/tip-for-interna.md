Add international money transfers to my list of activities that are now easier  
online than in the "real" world.

I had always found bank transfers a pain because they generally required a  
visit to the bank with stacks of forms to fill in. If lucky, my money disappeared  
for up to eight working days before arriving in the destination bank at a horrible exchange rate.

Recently [I wrote about my experiences using an online foreign currency exchange service](http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/02/24/yourmoney/mtransfer.php) that was easier, cheaper and faster than the bank.

Since it is easy to transfer small amounts, I now find the service a lifesaver.

What other new Web-based services could be useful for people who live abroad?
