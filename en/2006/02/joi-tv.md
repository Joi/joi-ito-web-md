[MX TV](http://www.mxtv.co.jp/) and Digital Garage approached me about hosting a TV show on MX TV's new terrestrial digital high definition broadcast channel. The market is quite small, covering only Tokyo and only viewable by people who have terrestrial digital tuners, but the good thing is that I'd be free to do just about anything I want. Starting July, they will broadcast to mobile phones with the proper tuners as well.

Originally, the plan was to start in April, but I'm arguing that we should push the launch back to July when we have the mobile phone viewers. This will also give me a bit more time to organize this. I've hosted TV shows in the past and I'm not particularly fond of them, but it sounded like I would have a lot of freedom and since it looks like they will agree to allowing me to license all of the content under a [Creative Commons BY license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/), we could all use the footage for other stuff and maybe I could launch a video blog.

I just set up a [wiki page](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?joi_tv) where I will be posting thoughts and ideas. Justin Hall will be helping me shoot some footage for the show at SXSW as well. If you're interested in participating in this project in some way, sign up on the wiki or comment here. It's still basically wide open at the moment, but here's what I have in mind.

- Weekly live broadcast for 30 min, Sat night 10 PM JST broadcast on MX TV as well as the net

- Show and B-Roll material available for download

- Active integration of [#joiito IRC channel](http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?ircchannel) for feedback and participation

- Japan blog roundup using [Technorati Japan](http://technorati.jp/home.html)

- Interviews of bloggers and other people by pre-recorded video and video conferencing/iChat AV

- Feature [Global Voices](http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/) stories

- Feature [Metroblogging](http://www.metroblogging.com/) bloggers

- See if I can do interviews in Second Life or World of Warcraft

- Feature amateur and viewer content and try to collaborate with schools and artists to make cool stuff

- Video blog format output of show

Anyway, we have a few more week before I have to start actually committing to the format so any thoughts on what would be cool would be greatly appreciated.
