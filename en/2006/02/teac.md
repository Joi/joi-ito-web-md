> A Creative Commons-licensed film by Davis Guggenheim

Experts predict that the US will need more than two million new teachers in the next decade. So, how do we inspire today’s young adults to become tomorrow’s educators?

In 1999, director [Davis Guggenheim](http://creativecommons.org/about/people#20) and producer [Julia Schachter](http://theoscarsite.com/whoswho8/schacter_j.htm) undertook an ambitious project — to document the experiences of teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District. In examining the trials and rewards that come with educating our children, the filmmakers created two powerful documentaries: the Peabody Award-winning [*The First Year*](http://www.pbs.org/firstyear); and Teach, a short film created to attract talented and passionate people to the teaching profession.

Teach is available under a Creative Commons [BY-NC-ND](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/) license and is offered online to the public for free. By using a CC license, Guggenheim and Schachter are allowing people to legally download and share Teach, so that its inspirational message can be easily seen by anyone in the world.
