Yesterday, Veni Markovski took Paul Twomey and me to go see Ivailo Kalfin, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria. Paul is the President/CEO of [ICANN](http://www.icann.org/) (I am on the board).

First of all, The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry has now licensed all of its content under a [Creative Commons 2.5 Attribution License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/bg/) . YAY!

The Minister also just started a [blog](http://www.kalfin.eu/) at http://www.kalfin.eu.

It was clear from the conversation that Veni was a well known (and mostly liked) maverick who had blazed the way for open Internet in Bulgaria with the support and help of the Minister. They talked about some of the policy war stories from the past.

Here is the press release from the meeting via the [Veni/ISOC Bulgaria blog:](http://blog.veni.com/?p=111)

He informed the guests about the current statistics about Internet usage by the citizens, companies and government.
