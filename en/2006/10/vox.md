As many of you already know, [Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/), which I my company [Neoteny](http://blog.neoteny.com/neoteny/) is an investor in has been working for awhile to develop [Vox](http://www.vox.com/home). (I'm the Chairman of [Six Apart Japan](http://sixapart.jp/) as well.) Vox is still in preview mode, but we're welcoming and asking friends to sign up and give it a try. It's free. I'm actually enjoying it a great deal and have been posting most of my stuff on [my Vox site](http://joi.vox.com/) these days. It feels more personal and is a bit more group oriented than this blog. Anyway, let me know if you have any questions and let me know what you think.
