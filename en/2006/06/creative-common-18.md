> ...today, Microsoft has released a free [Office plug-in](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=113B53DD-1CC0-4FBE-9E1D-B91D07C76504&displaylang=en) that enables you to mark Office documents (Word, Excel and PowerPoint) with [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) licenses. This has been in the works for a while, and is an extremely cool development. The plug-in will modify the FILE menu, adding an item “Creative Commons” and then when selected, link the user out to the CC site to select a license to be inserted into the license. The first document licensed with the tool is a speech by Brazil’s Culture Minister and supercool musician, Gilberto Gil, about tropicalism. ([en](http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/msoffice/GilbertoGil-en.doc)) ([pt](http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/msoffice/GilbertoGil-br.doc)).

This plug-in is for the Windows version of office only and doesn't work on the Mac. However, this is a great step in the direction of mainstream software recognizing and integrating Creative Commons and I would like to thank everyone who made this happen. As Larry states in his blog post, Microsoft has been on the right side of a number of issues and should be commended when they are.
