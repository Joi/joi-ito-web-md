Thanks to the colossal effort on the part of Nevin Thompson for the translation and transcription and the overtime work by Thor at [dotSUB](http://www.dotsub.com/) getting this posted, the MXTV show that I blogged earlier is [now available with English subtitles](http://www.dotsub.com/films/jicc/index.php). The show was directed by Shuichi Fujiyasu, "Peacedelic'ed" by Hiroyuki Nakano (who just won a Canne Young Critic award this year for his short film "Iron") and produced by Digital Garage. A lot of the video is just about me and stuff I'm interested in, but there is also a bunch of stuff about Creative Commons. Since it's on dotSUB, anyone who is interested can sign up and translate it into other languages. I'm slightly self-conscious posting a video which is mostly about me, but I think that parts of it are very cool and worth seeing. Shuichi Fujiyasu and Hiroyuki Nakano also did a very cool job of annotating the attributions for the attribution license. Of course, this version is also licensed under a [Creative Commons attribution 2.5 license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/).

Anyway, thanks for all the help.

PS : [The Nakano films](http://www.dotsub.com/films/nakano1/index.php) still need more help on the translation if you happen to have time. ;-)
