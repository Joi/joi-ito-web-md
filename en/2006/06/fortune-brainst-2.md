[Fortune Brainstorm 2006](http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/brainstorm/) starts today in Aspen. I've been to all of them so far and was bummed when they didn't have one last year. This is my favorite conference because of the diversity, the small size, and the rich content. I used to be one of the few bloggers that covered this conference. This year there are many other bloggers and Fortune has [their own blog](http://money.cnn.com/blogs/brainstorm/). I used to feel sort of sneaky [posting pictures of Michael Eisner wearing a Mickey Mouse T-Shirt](http://joi.ito.com/moblog/entries/2004/07/16/002749.html) or [scooping the Ted Turner talk](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/07/16/brainstorms_2004_dinner_interview_notes_ted_turner.html). This year, they took their revenge by [outing me on their blog](http://money.cnn.com/blogs/brainstorm/index.html#115150959216390598) as a warmup I think.

Anyway, I'll try to cover some of sessions with the pressure of more competition this year.
