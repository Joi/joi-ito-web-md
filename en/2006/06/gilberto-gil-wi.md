> Brazil's Minister of Culture Gilberto Gil partakes of "Free Beer" - brought to him at the iSummit in Rio de Janeiro June 2006.

There were a bunch of cameras rolling when Gilberto Gil got his free beer at the iCommons Summit. All of the video was licensed under a [CC Attribution](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/) license so Justin was able to edit together a multi-camera video of the Minister and his beer.
