I just saw a screening of the film "[The War Tapes](http://www.thewartapes.com/)", a documentary about soldiers in Iraq by soldiers in Iraq. The director Deborah Scranton is telling the story now. She was asked by the National Guard to do a documentary as an embedded journalist. Instead, she suggested that they give cameras to the soldiers and let them shoot the film. Soldiers were given cameras and she directed coordinated the editing via IM and email. The result is an amazingly candid and real film and it gave me a better view of what it is like to be a soldier in Iraq than anything else I've ever seen. Regardless of whether you support the war or not, I suggest you see this film.

It also gives me another perspective on the soldiers and the spouses of soldiers that I have met in our [World of Warcraft guild](http://weknow.to/)...

UPDATE: She directed the film by IM and it was edited when the soldiers returned from Iraq.
