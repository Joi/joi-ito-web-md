Loic was lugging a one-man-video setup around when we met in Helsinki. He talked me into doing a conversation so he could show off his gear. ;-) [He posted the video and audio on his blog](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2006/06/joi_ito_a_podca.html).

Loic has been interviewing amazing people for his blog. Unfortunately for me, the interviews are mostly in French. Maybe he should use [dotSUB](http://dotsub.com/)...
