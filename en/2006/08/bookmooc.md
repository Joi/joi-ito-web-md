On Friday, [I met John Buckman](http://joi.ito.com/moblog/entries/2006/08/05/004302.html). He runs Magnatune, a record label that uses Creative Commons. I've been a huge fan of [Magnatune](http://www.magnatune.com/) and had been looking forward to meeting him. At the meeting he told me about [BookMooch](http://bookmooch.com) which just launched today.

BookMooch is very cool.

It reminds me a bit of [BookCrossing](http://www.bookcrossing.com/), but the approach is different. BookCrossing is a way to leave books for people in public places and allow people to find these books. You get to track your book and has a neat book-as-artifact element.

BookMooch is more systematic. On BookMooch, you register your books and others search for books. You use points to get books that you earn by listing books. Unlike many other used book services, they don't get involved in the shipping and payment. It's peer-to-peer. Of course, if the book isn't available, there is a link to Amazon.com.

John is very good at combining clean sharing with business to provide a win-win for the various players. BookMooch and Magnatune both have John's sensibility. I view John as a rare example of a serial sharing economy entrepreneur.
