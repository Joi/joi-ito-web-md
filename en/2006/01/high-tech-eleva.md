Interesting that Toshiba Elevator and Building Systems Corp. will use so-called [**mag-lev technology in an elevator**](http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8F6I0781.htm?campaign_id=apn_home_down&chan=db) for the first time.

Mag-lev allows near frictionless movement by suspending objects in midair through a combination of magnetic attraction and repulsion, but the story's kicker is that while the mag-lev elevators will be quieter and more comfortable, Toshiba said conventional elevators can travel more than three times faster.

Meanwhile, Fujitec has announced [**a system to organize elevator riders**](http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060116/BIZ01/601160321/1076/BIZ) in order to stop bottlenecks and speed the flow of people to the correct floor. I have seen such systems in Hong Kong's municipal buildings. They are annoying at first ("Elevator 3 will now go to the 14th, 17th and 18th floor. Take elevator 4 to the 9th, 11th and 14th floor"), but they are efficient.

Regulating passenger flow is pretty low tech compared with suspending elevators on magnets, but that system seems likely to get you to your floor much more quickly. Are there any other notable low-tech solutions for high-tech situations?
