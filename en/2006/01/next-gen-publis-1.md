**By [Thomas Crampton](http://technorati.com/tag/Thomas+Crampton)**  
As a journalist, I admit to having more than a passing interest in the future of media/publishing. For "next generation" publishing, I currently see two main technical developments...

-wireless connections for ubiquitous Internet, and

-smaller and easier-to-read screens,

...that are bringing two main social changes...

-increased trust/reliance on peer-to-peer communication, and

-a more conversational style of journalism that contrasts with the previous model (that more resembled lecturing).

You can see the changes already having a concrete effect, with U.S. news magazines responding to the Internet --  [**in part by cutting back their foreign staff and editions**](http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/01/15/business/papers16.php).

What other broad forces **(social or technical or others)** will lead the next generation of publishing?
