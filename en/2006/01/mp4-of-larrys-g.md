Lawrence Lessig has posted [a torrent](http://www.prodigem.com/torrents/download/lessig/lessig-Google.torrent) to an mp4 file of his presentation about whether Google Book Search is Fair Use. It's a typically great presentation, but his [description on how he put the presentation together](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/003284.shtml) is also very cool.
