[Dan Gillmor](http://bayosphere.com/blog/dangillmor) has launched his [Center for Citizen Media](http://citmedia.org/blog/). [According to his post on Bayophere](http://bayosphere.com/blog/dan_gillmor/20051220/coming_soon_center_for_citizen_media), "Starting in 2006, I'll be putting together a nonprofit Center for Citizen Media. The goals are to study, encourage and help enable the emergent grassroots media sphere, with a major focus on citizen journalism." I have joined his [board of advisors](http://citmedia.org/blog/2006/01/03/board/). Good luck Dan! I think this direction is perfect for Dan.
