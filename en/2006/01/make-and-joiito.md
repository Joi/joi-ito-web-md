> Come to the MAKE and #joiito IRC channel MacWorld Meetup, Thursday, January 12, 2006 (12:30 PM - 2:30 PM). Moscone Center, San Francisco, Ca. The plan is to meet at the O'Reilly Media Booth #1017 where we'll will be hacking iPods and showing how to get DVDs and videos on your iPod - then we will all migrate from there." [Link](http://upcoming.org/event/48426). If you need a free pass to get in, here's a [PDF](http://www.macdevcenter.com/mac/2005/12/20/examples/oreilly.pdf).

I won't be there, but I expect a full report. Have fun. I'll try to be online if I can.
