Yesterday Larry asked me if I could go to a Creative Commons party with him. "Sure!" I said. "Hamlet Linden has the details. It's at 1PM in Second Life." I showed up in Second Life around 1:30PM and messaged Hamlet who teleported me to a beautiful tree house. Everyone was in kilts dancing. I clicked the play button on the music and my room was filled with the music they were dancing to. I was looking kind of drab in my semi-default gear, so I was quickly handed a kilt. Then I clicked the dance ball and I was dancing around with the rest of them. Soon Larry arrived and talked to everyone about Creative Commons. It was great meeting all of our new friends in such a beautiful place.

> Thanks to all who helped contribute a total of L$37,178 to the Creative Commons donation box provided by Pathfinder Linden. All funds are transferred to Lawrence Lessig's Second Life account, and from there sold and converted into US$ that are deposited directly to Creative Commons' official PayPal account. More events to benefit CC will be planned this [Wednesday](http://secondlife.com/events/event.php?id=145766&date=1138849200) and [Saturday](http://secondlife.com/events/event.php?id=145768&date=1139090400); join the Free Culture group to get involved!

Yay! Thanks!
