Earlier this month, [Mako](http://mako.cc/) circulated an email about Iron Blogger. Sounded useful and easy enough so I signed up... and failed. I missed the first deadline and I owe $5.

Off to a bad start, but I'll try not to miss anymore. Looking forward to blogging as well as the meetup.

> [Iron Blogger](http://iron-blogger.mako.cc/) is a blogging and drinking club based on this

>
> - Blog at least once a week.
> - If you fail to do so, pay $5 into a common pool.
> - When the pool is big enough, the group uses it to pay for drinks and
>   snacks at a meet-up for all the participants.

> Nelson Elhage ran [the original](http://iron-blogger.mit.edu/) Iron Blogger for about a year
> before the effort ran out of steam. I've started [a new instance](http://iron-blogger.mako.cc/)
> with a couple people from the previous group and [a bunch of folks](http://iron-blogger.mako.cc/participants/) from [Berkman](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/), [MIT](http://web.mit.edu), and beyond.

> If you live in Boston and want to join, there are still a couple of

> temporarily, at about 30 people because I think that's the maximum
> we'll fit into a local pub. Look over [the site](http://iron-blogger.mako.cc/) and [send me an email](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d9b4b8b2b6fffaefede2b8adbdb6adf7baba) if you're interested.
