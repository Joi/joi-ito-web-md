Today marks the official launch of the 2011 Creative Commons Annual Campaign! As the Chair of the CC Board, I invite you to join us in powering an open future. We've made tremendous progress in the last year, including:  
Europeana's new Data Exchange Agreement which releases the metadata for millions of cultural works into the public domain using CC0;  
Flickr reaching the 200 million mark in CC-licensed photos;  
YouTube adding a CC licensing option;  
The US Department of Labor requiring CC BY for a $2 billion grant program;  
Brazil and New Zealand introducing CC licensing for government-funded works;  
CC releasing The Power of Open, a book showcasing phenomenal use cases of CC licensing.

Creative Commons relies on donations to build and constantly improve the technical and legal tools that enable openness to flourish. The future of openness is bright, but ensuring that future requires urgent and sustained effort. CC is continuing to improve the usefulness of our licenses and helping even more artists, institutions and governments share their works. We are reaching a critical mass and need your support now more than ever. Donate now! <https://creativecommons.net/donate/>
