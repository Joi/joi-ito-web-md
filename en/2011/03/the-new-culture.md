[![A New Culture of Learning](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510t0ZxHWRL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-click,TopRight,35,-76_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/New-Culture-Learning-Cultivating-Imagination/dp/1456458884/)

As an "informal learner" who dropped out of college and managed to survive, ["The New Culture of Learning: cultivating imagination for a world of constant flux"](http://www.amazon.com/New-Culture-Learning-Cultivating-Imagination/dp/1456458884/) captures and provides a coherent framework for many of the practices that guide my own life. If their suggestions are able to be weaved into the discourse and practice of formal education, informal learners like myself might be able to survive without dropping out. In addition, even those who are able to manage formal education could have their experiences greatly enhanced.

John Seely Brown has continued to help give me confidence in the chaos + serendipity that is my life and have helped those who seek to understand people like us. This book brings together a lot of his work and the work of others (like my sister ;-) ) in a concise book definitely worth reading.
