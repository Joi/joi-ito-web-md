I recently invited Steven Johnson, author if Emergence and Tom Malone, the Director of the [MIT Center for Collective Intelligence](http://cci.mit.edu/) to join a conversation about Emergence over Authority, one of the principles in our new book Whiplash. This was part of a series of experiments that we are conducting in the [Facebook group for the book](https://www.facebook.com/groups/whiplashmovement/). We used a software system call [Soapbox.tv](https://soapbox.tv/) to stream the video to Facebook Live.
