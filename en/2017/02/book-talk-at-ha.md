[The Harvard Book Store](http://www.harvard.com/) hosted a book talk for my co-author [Jeff](https://camd.northeastern.edu/journalism/people/jeff-howe/) and me to talk about our new book [*Whiplash*](https://whiplashbook.com/). Thanks! It was a great group of people at a great venue. Jeff read a bit from the introduction, we chatted about the process and told some stories about writing the book and then we had a nice conversation with the people who gathered.
