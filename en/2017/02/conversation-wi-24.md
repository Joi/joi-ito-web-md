I first met Jamila when she and her associate Alia reached out to us after we posted a [video on Civil Disobedience](https://youtu.be/Dv3LyUoxYIE) inspired by and citing Gene Sharp. Jamila is the executive director of the Albert Einstein Institution that Gene Sharp founded to focus on understanding and spreading his methods for non-violent action. We had a conversation about this with Tenzin Priyadarshi - [the video is here](https://youtu.be/6MuTuui8bWs) (Sorry about the poor audio quality).

After talking to Jamila some more, it was clear that she inspired many of us and we could learn a lot from her. In addition, it seemed that many of our technologies could be useful for her in her works so I invited her to join the Lab initially as a research affiliate.

Recently, I asked her to give a talk and have a conversation with the Lab and myself. This is a video of the talk. Audio of the talk and conversation are available on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/31-conversation-with-jamila-raqib/id1149206722?i=1000380551288&mt=2) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/joi-ito/conversation-with-jamila-raqib).
