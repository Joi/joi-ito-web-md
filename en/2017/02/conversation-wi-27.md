[Darren Walker](https://www.fordfoundation.org/people/darren-walker/) and the Ford Foundation threw a book party for my new book [Whiplash](https://whiplashbook.com/) (Thanks!) and Megan came a bit early so I got a chance to sit down with her and do a Facebook Live. [Megan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Smith) is the former CTO of the United States serving under President Obama. She's an MIT grad, did her thesis work at the Media Lab, is on the corporation board of MIT and the [advisory council](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/?filter=advisory-council) and [visiting committee](http://web.mit.edu/corporation/visiting/media.html) of the Media Lab. She's also the one who first asked me whether I wanted to be considered for the role of the Director of the Media Lab so I owe a lot to her. I've known Megan for a long time and it was great catching up.

We talked about tech, digital government, inclusion and the opportunities ahead.
