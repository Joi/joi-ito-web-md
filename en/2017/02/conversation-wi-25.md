My sister Mimi came over the other day and we decided to do a Facebook Live. We talked about learning, education, digital media and the social science around this stuff. We also talked a bit about her new startup, [Connected Camps](https://connectedcamps.com/).

The audio is available on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/33-conversation-with-mimi-ito/id1149206722?i=1000381127236&mt=2) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/joi-ito/33-conversation-with-mimi-ito).
