Andre and Karthik were both took the [Principles in Awareness](http://aware.media.mit.edu/details) class that Tenzin Priyadarshi and I taught twice over the last few years. They both independently became interested in connecting the idea of non-duality and artificial intelligence. We'd been Slacking and chatting and thinking about the topic so I invited Andre over for lunch the other day and Skyped Karthik in from India and did a Facebook Live about the topic.

The audio is available on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/27-conversation-andre-karthik/id1149206722?i=1000379404103&mt=2) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/joi-ito/conversation-with-andre-and).

The next step is to write up a short post about the idea. :-)
