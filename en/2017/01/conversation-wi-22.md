I first met Karole Armitage at a dinner [Tod Machover](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/tod/overview/)'s home. (Tod is a faculty member at the Media Lab.) Karole was a perfect candidate for the [Director's Fellows](http://directorsfellows.media.mit.edu/) program and she agreed to join us.

Karole describes herself as a former "punk ballerina" and through dance and movement is able to connect so many interesting ideas and worlds. She's already started to actively collaborate with a number of people at the Lab. In this conversation we discuss some of those collaborations as well as some new ideas.
