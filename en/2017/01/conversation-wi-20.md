I first met Virginia in 2015 when she and I were on [a panel with Fareed Zarkaria at the Connecticut Forum](https://www.ctforum.org/about-us/the-connecticut-forum-blog/get-in-the-know-about-joi-ito-fareed-zakaria-virginia-heffernan/). Late last year, she and Panio from Heleo reached out to see if I'd join Virginia in a conversation over Skype. [Heleo](https://heleo.com/) "curates compelling, candid conversations between writers and thinkers about their work, research, and interests." [You can see their great summary of the conversation on their website](https://heleo.com/conversation-media-hacking-and-tech-revolutions-in-the-age-of-trump/12321/).

After the conversation, I asked if I could repackage the audio as a Podcast which you can find on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/conversation-virginia-heffernan/id1149206722?i=1000379579593&mt=2) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/joi-ito/conversation-with-virginia).

Virginia and I had recently gotten each other's books and a wide ranging but super-fun conversation ensued. It definitely left me excited to talk to Virginia again and expanded the perspective - thinking about the Internet in the context of art and design - that she covers in her book. We talk about the media, the Internet (yes, I still capitalize "Internet"), design, art, culture and many other things.

Also, as I explore various modes of publishing conversations online, I find it fascinating running into others exploring this space too.

If you've finished reading [Whiplash](https://whiplashbook.com/), definitely pick up [MAGIC AND LOSS: The Internet as Art](http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Magic-and-Loss/Virginia-Heffernan/9781439191705) if you haven't already. It's great.
