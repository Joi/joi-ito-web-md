[The new twhirl looks great](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2009/01/the-new-twhirl-is-here-preview-release-for-team-seesmic-twhirl.html). Twhirl is a client that lets you track a bunch of different services like [Twitter](http://twitter.com/), [identi.ca](http://identi.ca/), [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/) and [Seemic](http://seesmic.com/). The new version lets you record to Seemsic, search Twitters (in a very smart way) and post via [Ping.fm](http://ping.fm/). For me (I'm biased), the Ping.fm integration is key. Now I can do my posting and reading from Twhirl. The service is in a closed test period, but I think it will be released very soon.

My status update streams are still a bit of a mess with comments all over the place, but this is a step in the right direction to try to help make it easier to keep track of things.
