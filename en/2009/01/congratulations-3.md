First of all, a teary-eyed congratulations to all of my friends in America. I'm really proud of and happy for the Americans and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for making such a great choice and proving to us that democracy works in America. My faith in America has increased substantially today and I look forward to the leadership it may provide.

I'll write more about this when I calm down a bit and get some sleep. (It's 3AM here.)

However, before I went to bed I wanted to thank President Obama and his team for bringing [a copyright notice to the White House website](http://www.whitehouse.gov/copyright/) which includes Creative Commons. Thank you very much.
