[Dopplr](http://www.dopplr.com/) has created personal reports for its users for last year. They come in the form of a PDF that you can download from your Dopplr page. It's a pretty nifty visualization licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license.

For some reason, I thought I was away from home more than half the time, but according to Dopplr, I was home 184/365 days last year. My travel coincided most with Lawrence Lessig. I took 49 trips and traveled 143% of the distance to the moon (521,809 km/324,237 miles) and had an average velocity of 58.43 km/hr or the speed of a whippet. (My mileage program total for actual travel miles is much higher than this. I wonder if Dopplr measuring the direct distance vs the actual travel paths by the airlines would account for this...)

The thing that weighs the most heavily on my heart is the approximately 60 ton (6 Hummers worth) carbon footprint that I have. I think this is about three times the 20 tons or so of an average American. I do offset my carbon with a number of offset services, but I still think that the carbon cost of my travel, more than anything else, is the main thing I should consider when I try to decide whether to take a particular trip or not.

[Dopplr also published Barack Obama's report.](http://blog.dopplr.com/2009/01/15/dopplr-presents-the-personal-annual-report-2008-freshly-generated-for-you-and-barack-obama/)
