I've been wondering what the proper notation for my comments when retweeting was.

I'd been using either:
> RT @foo blah blah (me: foobar)

or
> RT @foo blah blah | foobar

The first seems to be excessive in terms of characters and the second is ambiguous unless there was some sort of convention.

I Just twittered:
> [Have we decided on the proper notation for commenting on a retweet?](http://twitter.com/Joi/status/1661114941)

And got the following responses so far:

> [j0anna: @Joi I prefer it appended at the end, rather than the beginning! Distracts from the content at the beginning, gives credit where due at end!](http://twitter.com/j0anna)
>
> [kevinmarks: » @Joi: Have we decided on the proper notation for commenting on a retweet? « I use these French quote marks, but that's just me](http://twitter.com/kevinmarks)
>
> [danlatorre: @Joi clearer to [comment] RT [tweet] than RT [tweet] | [comment], which is confusing. Use the "RT" as the demarcation, saves chars.](http://twitter.com/danlatorre)

> [JoshAuerbach: @Joi I think it's clearest when the commentary precedes the RT notation. Otherwise, I go with "Me: ..." in parentheses.](http://twitter.com/JoshAuerbach)

Clearly we don't have a consensus. I should have used a hashtag so we can follow this more easily on Twitter. How about [#rtnotation](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23rtnotation)? (I probably should have linked to the actual tweets instead of twitter ID's but I need to get this posted before people twitter even more..)

BTW: This was about 20 minutes of twitter I think...
