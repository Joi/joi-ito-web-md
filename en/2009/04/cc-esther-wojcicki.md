[Esther Wojcicki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Wojcicki) who [joined our board in July last year](http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2008/07/11/esther-wojcicki.html) has taken the role of chair of the board of Creative Commons. I will continue to serve as the CEO. From the [press release](http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/13736):

  
> "I am thrilled to take on this new role," said Wojcicki. "I strongly believe that the Creative Commons approach to sharing, reuse, and innovation has the power to totally reshape the worlds of education, science, technology, and culture at large. My main goal as chair is to make average Internet users worldwide aware of Creative Commons and to continue building the organization's governance and financial resources. I am also very eager to help CC's education push at high school and college journalism programs worldwide."
