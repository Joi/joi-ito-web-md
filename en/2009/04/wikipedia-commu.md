Very important vote happening for the free culture community. Please vote "yes" if you're qualified.

Cross-posted from the [Creative Commons Blog](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13967):

A community vote is now underway, hopefully one of the final steps in the process the migration of Wikipedia (actually Wikipedias, as each language is its own site, and also other Wikimedia Foundation sites) to using [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) as its primary content license.

This migration would be a huge boost for the free culture movement, and for Wikipedia and Creative Commons -- until the migration happens there is an unnecessary licensing barrier between the most important free culture project (Wikipedia of course, currently under the Free Documentation License, intended for software documentation) and most other free culture projects and individual creators, which use the aforementioned CC BY-SA license.

To [qualify](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Licensing_update#Decision-making_process) to vote, one must have made 25 edits to a Wikimedia site prior to March 15. Make sure you're logged in to the project on which you qualify, and you should see a site notice at the top of each page that looks like the image below (red outline added around notice).

Click on "vote now" and you'll be taken to the voting site.

Indeed, please go vote **yes** to unify the free culture movement!
