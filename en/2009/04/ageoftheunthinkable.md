I've [written about my friend Joshua Ramo](http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2008/08/09/joshua-ramo-at.html) in the past and mention his new book *The Age of the Unthinkable* in my blog post about [Dubai and the unknowable](http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2009/02/07/dubai-and-prepa.html). I was reading a proof of the book during my trip and it helped spark that post.

[Joshua](http://joshuaramo.com/) has a background in physics, journalism and foreign affairs. I'm pretty sure he's the only person I know who has interviewed both the head of Israeli intelligence and the CTO of the Hizbollah. He is one of the few people I know who is as crazy about experiencing new cultures as me. Unlike me, Joshua can write and is extremely well read and his new book The Age of the Unthinkable describes through narratives, facts and theory, the framework that describes better than any book I know, the way that I look at the world, current events and my own relationship to this world.

One way of describing the book is *Black Swan* written in a non-arrogant, more constructive and culturally deep and thoughtful way.

I highly recommend this book. It is [available on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Age-Unthinkable-Disorder-Constantly-Surprises/dp/0316118087/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1238184278&sr=8-1). [Johsua has a website for the book](http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/features/unthinkable/index.html). (I think Boris did the design. :-) ) You can also see Joshua on the [TODAY Show](http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/29899899/), [NPR's All Things Considered](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102063405), and [WNYC Brian Lehrer](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl/episodes/2009/03/24).
