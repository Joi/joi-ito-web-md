Just arrived in Japan after a visit to Chicago, Dubai and Singpore - three major hub cities. It was interesting to contrast them. Obviously, Chicago isn't a hub in the same way as Dubai and Singapore are hubs, but there are similarities.

My apartment in Dubai still isn't ready. It's starting to feel a bit like home, especially thanks to all of my friends there, but I'm sure I'll feel a lot more settled in when I have a my own space and all of my "stuff" moved in. Planning to spend more time there when it cools down again in the fall. ;-)

Uploaded my photos to Flickr and Picasa but going to try using Fotopedia widgets to post them here.
