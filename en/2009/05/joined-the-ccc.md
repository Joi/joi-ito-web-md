*Muneaki Masuda*

Muneaki Masuda, the CEO of [CCC Co., Ltd.](http://www.ccc.jp/english/) recently invited me to join his board and I officially joined yesterday.

I've known Mr. Masuda for about a decade having been in various study groups and working groups together. He and CCC/Tsutaya built the rental video franchise industry in Japan in the 80's and now runs the largest syndicated point system in Japan with about 30M users.

My role on the board will to help out with Internet things and International things.

More details later...
