One of the groups in the Royal Film Commission Online Media workshop worked on a video of the workshop itself. There will be a more lengthy and hopefully Arabic subtitled version of the workshop going online after some editing by the RFC. This video is a student-made video which describes the workshop and the various groups and their projects.
