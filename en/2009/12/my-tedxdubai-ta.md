This is a talk that I gave at TEDxDubai about open innovation in October. It's fairly similar to the talk I gave in Italy, but slightly longer and broader.

[TEDx Dubai 2009 - Joichi Ito](http://vimeo.com/8456140) from [Giorgio Ungania](http://vimeo.com/giorgio) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

Following is the Prezi that I used.

PS : There is a section where I talked about Infoseek's original business model of trying to charge each user per search. It might sound like I was involved in the pivot to advertising when I said, "we were thinking". While I helped run Infoseek Japan later, at the time that decision was being made, I was just a user and I meant that "we" as a community were trying to figure out how to monetize. Just want to be clear and not take credit for things I didn't do. ;-)
