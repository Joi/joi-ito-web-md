I'm sorry my [Ada Lovelace Day](http://findingada.com/) post is a day late. I've been trying to think of WHO. There are so many women who contribute to technology and so many that I respect, that picking one is really hard, but making a long list also seems to diminish the value and risks leaving people out by accident.

While this may seem a bit nepotistic and weird, I think I'm going to choose my sister, [Mimi](http://www.itofisher.com/mito/). As a big brother, I've been guilty of underestimating her and ignoring her accomplishments over the years.

Recently, my sister and I run into each other a lot as her work in anthropology has taken her down the path of [trying to understand how people interact with media and technology](http://digitalyouth.ischool.berkeley.edu/). Being smarter, more methodical and academic than me, she brings a lot of rigor into my someone shallow and intuitive thoughts and I'm now both dependent on and respectful of the insight she brings.

It feels a bit weird posting nice things about your kid sister (yes, she's younger than me, even though she acts more mature than me) but I guess I should probably do it occasionally. Also, one important foundation person said to me recently, "Mimi adds to your credibility," so it's probably a good idea to remind people we're related.
