TinyPictures, a company that I'm an investor in and have been involved in for a long time just released integration with Flickr. The Radar team are really good at mobile apps and have focused for a long time on the social/sharing/comment part of sharing photos. With Flickr integration, the Radar app has now become my client of choice for Flickr reading and commenting on my Blackberry and iPhone.

Gratz to the Radar team and tons of thanks for the Flickr folks for helping out.
